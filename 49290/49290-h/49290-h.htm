THE THUNDER STORM.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was dusk; and the mountains were reverberating
with loud thunder-claps, while the rain
helped to swell a turbid river that swept through the
valley, and past the door of a small <i>wirth-haus</i> or
inn, known less by its sign of "The Crown," than
as "am Sand," by reason of the strip of sand on
which it was built.</p>

<p>A cheerful looking, comely woman, clad in a
superabundance of woollen petticoats, was busy at
the stove, cooking the supper of a foot-traveller who
read a crumpled newspaper at the window; while
surrounding the kitchen-table, three or four peasants,
who had been driven in by the rain, were hungrily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
supping milk-porridge from a large bowl common to
them all. A pretty girl of sixteen, after adding to
their meal a basket of coarse rye-cakes, spread a
small table for the stranger, who, as soon as his
supper was served, fell upon it with avidity. His
hostess, meanwhile, retired to the end of the kitchen,
where there was a great meal-bin, and began to set
the bread for the morrow's baking, closely watched,
all the time, by two little girls with long braids of
hair hanging down their backs.</p>

<p>"The thunder still rumbles," said a man who was
quietly smoking near the stove. He was about forty
years of age; his person was strong and manly, with
slightly rounded shoulders; his full, dark eyes
beamed with gentleness; his clustering, deep brown
hair fell low on his broad forehead, and continued
round his face in a beard that became coal-black
towards the chin. He looked kind and enduring
rather than impetuous, and not unaptly represented
the image of strength in repose.</p>

<p>He wore a close-fitting grass-green coat over a
scarlet waistcoat, on which hung a rosary and crucifix
between his green, embroidered braces; black knee-breeches,
scarlet stockings, and laced half-boots.
The quiet self-possession of his manner bespoke
him the <i>wirth</i>, or master of the inn.</p>

<p>"The thunder still rumbles," said he.</p>

<p>"Aye aye, Sandwirth," answered one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
peasants, grinning; "better to be under cover than
half-way between this and St. Martin's."</p>

<p>"Father," said a lad, running into the house,
"two men are coming hither. And I think," added
he eagerly, under his breath, "the tallest of them is
Joseph Speckbacher."</p>

<p>"Hist!" said his father, laying aside his pipe,
while he glanced furtively at the stranger.</p>

<p>At the same time, the rustics, having finished
their supper, departed, without caring for the skirt
of the storm, which they pronounced clearing off,
though large drops continued to fall heavily.</p>

<p>"Those labourers seem content with homely
fare," said the traveller, pushing aside his plate.</p>

<p>"They don't taste meat once a fortnight," said
the Sandwirth, "and yet you see what strong, active
fellows they are. Shall you take a bed here, sir, to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, I would sooner go on, if it were not for the
storm."</p>

<p>"It will soon blow over," said the Wirth.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you have a book to lend me, meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said the girl Theresa, bringing him
one with alacrity.</p>

<p>"This? Hum! the 'South German Plutarch,'"
muttered the traveller&mdash;"I doubt if I shall not drop
asleep over it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>And, laying his legs up on a wooden stool, he
began to turn over the leaves.</p>

<p>Two men here came in, panting and laughing.
"What a storm!" cried one, laying his conical hat
with its drenched feather on the table. "How are
you, Anderl?" extending his brown muscular hand
to him.</p>

<p>"Well; praised be Jesus Christ!" said the Sandwirth,
reverently; to which the two others replied
with seriousness&mdash;</p>

<p>"For ever and ever, Amen!"</p>

<p>It is the usual Tyrolese ejaculation, when a new
comer enters the house. There is something simple
and solemn in it, when spoken reverently, which it
always is.</p>

<p>"How is your good Maria?" said the Sandwirth's
wife, coming forward. "And your little boy,
Anderl's namesake?"</p>

<p>"Well, both of them, thanks to God; though
Maria has now three youngsters on her hands. But,
Sandwirth, have you heard the news? The Archduke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hist!" again said the Sandwirth softly, laying
his hand on the other's breast; and indicating by a
wary glance of his eye, the presence of the stranger.
The other replied by a look. His companion, a
younger man, gave a gesture of impatience, and
whispered, "Is he going to stay?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"All in good time," said the Sandwirth cheerily.
"We are just going to sup, and you will join us.
One thing at a time will last the longer."</p>

<p>"Aye, Anderl, that is always your word," said
his wife, good-humouredly, as she placed about four
pounds of boiled bacon on the table. "You never
could bear to season eating with business."</p>

<p>"Have you a good horse to sell, just now, Sandwirth?"
said the younger and shorter of the newly
arrived, by way of general conversation.</p>

<p>"How should I have a horse to sell?" returned
the Wirth, dragging a heavy wooden bench towards
the table. "I know no more of selling horses,
Franz, than you do of selling brandy."</p>

<p>At which they all laughed, as a capital joke. The
family and their two friends then sat down to their
homely meal.</p>

<p>"So you are going to give us a shooting-match
on Sunday," said the young man whom the Wirth
had called Franz.</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;s," said the Sandwirth reluctantly; "but
I don't altogether like it."</p>

<p>"You don't? And why not, Sandwirth?"</p>

<p>"I doubt it's being quite right."</p>

<p>"Why, it brings you plenty of custom!"</p>

<p>"Aye, Franz; and, in your eyes, that settles the
question; but I doubt if it be a good way of spending
the Sabbath. If I were a maker of laws, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I'm never likely to be, I'd put down Sabbath-breaking."</p>

<p>"But, Sandwirth," said the taller man, in a peculiarly
full, rich, earnest voice, "the Sandwirths,
your ancestors, used to give Sabbath shooting-matches
on this very spot. Look at the glorious
old targets hanging like trophies on your wall. I
remember, the first time I ever came in sight of
this house was on a Sunday afternoon, and the
sharp, quick, rattling reports of the rifles echoed
among the hills. You yourself stood umpire among
a knot of young fellows in green jackets and red
sashes; and your grey-headed father sat at a long
table covered with hammers, screw-drivers, powder-flasks,
ramrods, and everything that could be
wanted."</p>

<p>"He did so, Speckbacher. You bring the scene
before me." And the Wirth's deep-set, large dark
eyes seemed dwelling on some far-off picture.</p>

<p>"You yourself hit the bull's eye twice, Anderl!"</p>

<p>"I did so, Joseph. 'Twas the day that I told old
Gasper, who called me a beardless boy, that if he
lived long enough, he should see my beard reach my
girdle; and he laughed and said, when that day
came, he would give me two oxen."</p>

<p>"So that's the reason you wear a beard!" cried
Franz. "But, Sandwirth, surely such a match as
that we have been speaking of, was fine sport! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
call it play, not work; and therefore no breaking of
the Sabbath."</p>

<p>The Sandwirth, however, would not retract.</p>

<p>"Play like that," said he, thoughtfully and impressively,
as though he weighed every word before
he spoke it, "is often as fatiguing as work; and it
sometimes leads to quarrels, and to taking God's
holy name in vain. Anyhow, it is not <em>rest</em>; and
God bade us <em>rest</em>, mind you, on the Sabbath-day."</p>

<p>"Pleasure <em>is</em> rest," said Franz.</p>

<p>"No, pleasure is often the hardest of work," said
the Sandwirth.</p>

<p>"That's true, too," said Speckbacher, as if a
sudden light streamed in upon him.</p>

<p>"Well, I know, to lie on my back with nothing
to do but twiddle my thumbs, would to me be the
hardest work of all," said Franz.</p>

<p>"I wonder," said Speckbacher, after a short pause,
"if such are your views, that you mean to have a
Sunday shooting-match at all."</p>

<p>"I've a purpose," said the Wirth in a low voice;
and then, in a louder key, as he rose and went
towards the door, "I am going forth to look at
the weather, sir," said he. "The storm has, I
think, overblown; but if not, and you like to
pass the night here, my wife shall prepare you
a bed."</p>

<p>"By no means; if the weather is really clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
up," said the traveller, "I shall yet push on; for it
is not late."</p>

<p>"The clouds have rolled off, and the valley is
sparkling in the last sun-gleam," said the Wirth.</p>

<p>"Very well. How much to pay?"</p>

<p>"Fifty kreutzers," said the hostess.</p>

<p>"Can you change me this zwanziger?"</p>

<p>While the good woman was mustering change,
the traveller rested his chin on his knuckles, and
attentively surveyed Speckbacher.</p>

<p>He was undeniably one of Nature's chieftains.
His height was uncommon, and his lofty carriage of
the neck and head, when excited, worthy of one of
the old Greeks. But often that gallant head drooped,
and a look of deep depression shaded his countenance.
There was something intrepid in his mien; he was
one from whom you would never expect to hear
a lie, or a sentiment that was base. His language
was homely, but energetic; his features were good,
his hair and eyes coal-black. His age might be
thirty-five.</p>

<p>Franz was full ten years younger, and had tolerable
features, but a kind of rakish, good-for-nothing air
that was rather repelling.</p>

<p>"Why won't you have anything to say to me?"
he was asking Theresa. "You seem to be knitting all
your wits into that blue worsted stocking. If Rudolf,
now, were here, you'd brighten up directly."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"But as he isn't, there's no occasion for it," said
Theresa, carelessly, and continuing to knit with all
her might.</p>

<p>"What a pleasant voice you have, Theresa! I
wish you would sing us a song."</p>

<p>"That's likely, isn't it?" said the girl.</p>

<p>"Come now, do."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am going to take my little sisters
to bed." And she moved away from him. He
looked after her with a mixture of admiration and
pique.</p>

<p>Just as the traveller, after some inquiries about
the roads, was about to depart, two more men hastily
entered. The first was a Capuchin friar, of stalwart
make, with the hood of his brown woollen gown
pulled so forward that nothing could readily be made
out of him but a thick, flowing beard of the hue that
partial mothers are apt to call auburn, though others
often pronounce it red.</p>

<p>"The peace of God rest on this house, through
Jesus Christ our Lord!" said he.</p>

<p>"For ever and ever!" meekly responded the rest.</p>

<p>The Capuchin's companion was a light, active
young mountaineer of three-and-twenty, brown as
a nut, and well becoming the picturesque national
costume. As soon as Theresa, who was just leaving
the kitchen, saw him, she reddened very much, and
hastily withdrew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"How the Passeyr is swollen already!" said the
Capuchin.</p>

<p>"Is the water out?" cried the traveller, suddenly.
"Then I don't know that I've any mind to go on."</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!" said the Sandwirth, rather impatiently,
"the river cannot have overflowed its banks.
You see it has not hindered these foot-travellers.
However, sir," changing his tone to one more conciliatory,
"if you will oblige us with your company,
you shall have as good and clean a bed as any in the
Tyrol, though I cannot promise you a flounced
pillow and satin damask coverlet, such as you might
get at Botzen."</p>

<p>"No, no, I'll take my chance," said the man of
indecision. "Is there any one here that will see me
through the valley?"</p>

<p>"You cannot well miss your road, sir; but my
boy Johann shall start you on it, if you will."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will give him a few kreutzers."</p>

<p>"No need, sir, thank you."</p>

<p>And the Sandwirth saw him out, and gave him
some encouragement about the weather, and watched
him off; and then returned laughing. The others
laughed too.</p>

<p>"Gone at last!" exclaimed Franz. "I thought
he never would make up his mind."</p>

<p>"Now for business," said Speckbacher, looking
eager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have hardly spoken to Father Joachim yet,"
said the Sandwirth, approaching the Capuchin, and
kneeling. "Your blessing, father!"</p>

<p>The Capuchin, before blessing him, threw back
his hood, thereby revealing a frank, determined, intelligent
countenance. He was by no means an old
man; probably a few years younger, even, than
Speckbacher, and apparently his equal in strength.</p>

<p>"Anna, is there still any supper left?" said the
Sandwirth, rather apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied his wife; "I hope Father
Joachim will never find our larder quite empty.
Johann caught a trout weighing three pounds, this
morning."</p>

<p>"Draw in, Rudolf," said the Sandwirth cheerfully
to the young mountaineer; "and don't sit at that
awful distance, my lad, as if you were not one
of us."</p>

<p>Rudolf bashfully obeyed. At the same time,
Theresa, who had tucked up her little sisters with
considerable expedition, re-entered, and began sedulously
to assist her mother in preparing Father
Joachim's supper. She had not been absent many
minutes, yet had contrived to slip on clean white
full sleeves under her trim violet velvet bodice&mdash;a
circumstance which did not escape the vigilant eye
of Franz.</p>

THE INN KITCHEN.</h2>

<p class="uni"><span class="qmark">"</span><span class="dropcap">W</span>HO was that stranger, Anderl?" said
Father Joachim.</p>

<p>"A flat-faced Bavarian, I think, father," said
the Sandwirth: "cunning as a fox! He took note
of every word we said."</p>

<p>"You said nothing incautious, then, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Nothing whatever, father; we talked of shooting-matches
and Sabbath-breaking."</p>

<p>"Good. Now then&mdash;here is a bag of money."</p>

<p>"For what, father?"</p>

<p>"For laying in stores of various sorts; which
you, as an innkeeper, may do without suspicion.
You may, perhaps, even contrive to conceal some
ammunition."</p>

<p>"Doubtless, father; though this is not a particularly
good hiding-place."</p>

<p>"You will be at some expense too about your
shooting-matches."</p>

<p>"You think them quite justifiable, father?"</p>

<p>"Quite, my son. I think, in this instance, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
end will justify the means. This will be a holy war;
and the meetings, ostensibly for sport, will cover
our arrangements. None among us are traitors, but
some may be indiscreet, and these must not be
trusted, but quietly sent away to the mountain
châlets. This will be mortifying, but they will still
be of service, for some must keep our flocks and
herds, or how can the others be spared to fight?
There must be one common purpose among us,
without heart-burnings or jealousies."</p>

<p>"There must. There shall."</p>

<p>"It is easy to say there must,&mdash;there shall,&mdash;but
are you yourself, Hofer, willing to co-operate with
Martin Teimer, or perhaps even occasionally to be
subordinate to him? There has been some coldness,
I think, between you?"</p>

<p>"On my side, none," said the Sandwirth, after a
little hesitation; "I bear him no ill will, nor do
I know why he should bear any to me. The man's
an able man; more so than I; and has already been
raised from a private to a major in the militia,
though, just now, he only keeps a tobacco-shop,
which is no better, I take it, than keeping a wirth-haus.
That's neither here nor there. I'll co-operate
with him, or serve under him, whenever it
needs."</p>

<p>"This is the spirit that must reign among us all,"
said Father Joachim. "We must exemplify the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Scripture rule, 'Let each esteem other better than
himself.' 'Him that is greatest among you, let him
be your servant;' if by being so, he can be of the
most good. Do you go with me, my children?
Can you submit to this? Will you be content?"</p>

<p>"We will!" was simultaneously responded. The
two young men spoke lowest: Rudolf, from the
modesty natural to him; Franz, because he thought
the requirement rather hard.</p>

<p>"Then listen to me. Prepare for action. In a
few days we shall rise."</p>

<p>"Hurrah! hurrah!"</p>

<p>And short, loud, abrupt shouts burst from the
men's lips. The next instant, their glowing eyes
were fixed on the Capuchin in profound silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, my children,&mdash;here is the proclamation,"
continued Father Joachim, drawing a paper from his
bosom; "hear it&mdash;</p>

<p>"'To arms, Tyroleans! To arms! The hour of
deliverance is at hand. Your beloved emperor,
Francis, calls on you to arm in a most holy cause,
which, after a long and treacherous peace, stands
forth like a rock in the deluge, the last remaining
defence of the liberties of Europe!</p>

<p>"'You must now either rise while Napoleon is
busy in another part of Europe, attempting to load
the Spaniards with a foreign yoke, or wait till he
has accomplished that project, and returns to crush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Austria, the only remaining obstacle to his aim at
universal power.</p>

<p>"'Your choice is made! Then look up to us!
Everything is already in motion. You will again
see at your head your beloved Archduke John, to
whom every inch of the Tyrol is known and endeared,
and whose greatest pain is ever to be separated
from you.</p>

<p>"'It is impossible that a separation between
Austria and Tyrol, like that of 1805, can again take
place&mdash;a separation so bitterly felt! Bavaria declared
that the Tyrolese should not only retain their
ancient rights and freedom, but that their welfare
should be promoted in every possible manner, and
"that no iota of their constitution should be
changed."</p>

<p>"'How your honest hearts rejoiced at this royal
promise! But how has it been kept? You have
seen your abbeys and monasteries destroyed, your
church property confiscated, your churches profaned,
your bishops and priests banished. Your knights
and nobles have been stripped of their old, hereditary
honours; your cities and courts of justice, your
industrious citizens and tradespeople, have alike
had their interests sacrificed; heavy taxes have been
imposed, and no mercy has been shown towards
those who could not pay them.</p>

<p>"'Tyroleans! when you recollect all this,&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
you consider the treacherous conduct of the Bavarians,
and remember that you have never taken
the oath of allegiance to them,&mdash;you will have but
one thought, one purpose; and your lips will alone
utter the word Deliverance!'"</p>

<p>"God save the emperor!" ejaculated the Sandwirth.</p>

<p>"And bless our cause!" added Speckbacher,
deeply moved.</p>

<p>"It will be comparatively easy," said Father
Joachim, "for Bavaria to penetrate our country as
far as Innsbruck; but, from that point, our enemies
will find themselves in a complete network of defiles,
ravines, gorges, and valleys&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From which, if we let them escape, we shall be
fools!" cried Speckbacher.</p>

<p>"They are many, and we are few, my son."</p>

<p>"They fight for kreutzers, and we for freedom,
father."</p>

<p>"True; and therefore I believe we shall win the
day, but it will be a hard-fought one. From Carinthia
the foe will approach us through the valley of
the Drave; from Italy through the valley of the
Adige. We must hem them in, and cut them off,
before they effect a junction. No time must be lost
in fortifying the mountain passes. On the 9th of
April, a division of Austrian troops will advance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"God be thanked! Under the Archduke John?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Under General Chastelar and Baron Hormayr.
You look disappointed, Hofer; but they are good
men and true.&mdash;Directly they begin to march, the
Tyrol must rise. You must ring your alarm-bells
and kindle your beacons; send messages to every
dwelling within reach, and billets inscribed '<cite>'Tis
time</cite>' to those afar off. Saw-dust scattered on
the rivers will be a signal to the men lower down
the valleys that you are in arms. The foe will
probably endeavour to reach the Brenner by way
of Brixen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He must be intercepted!"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. Who will lead the men of the
Passeyrthal over the Jauffen? Andreas Hofer, will
<em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>A deep red flush rose to the Sandwirth's temples.
He rose; and, in a low, firm voice, replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"I will."</p>

<p>"Let us make some memoranda, then, of men
and places&mdash;"</p>

<p>Some humble writing implements were placed on
the table; and Hofer, after trying the point of a
stumpy pen on his thumb, offered it, with a crumpled
piece of paper, to Father Joachim, who, however,
produced his own pocket-book, while the Sandwirth
and Speckbacher reckoned up to him the number of
men they thought they might muster. Rudolf presently
went round to Theresa, and whispered, "Can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
you give me some bits of wood? I might be
cutting some billets and inscribing them."</p>

<p>She mutely nodded, went out, and returned with
her apron full. He took out his clasp-knife and
quietly set to work; and Franz, after a lazy fashion,
helped him.</p>

<p>"Five thousand strong," at length said the
Capuchin.</p>

<p>"There or thereabouts," said Hofer. "Speckbacher
must count up the men about Halle."</p>

<p>His little boy here stole up to him.</p>

<p>"So, Johann," said his father, in a lowered voice,
while Speckbacher reckoned up the men of Halle,
"you set the stranger on his way. Did he say anything
to you?"</p>

<p>"Only asked a heap of questions about the shooting
match, father."</p>

<p>"Humph! Nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Only about Speckbacher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of me?" hastily said Speckbacher, overhearing
him.</p>

<p>"Only who you were. I said you took wood to
the salt-works."</p>

<p>"Humph! Was that all?"</p>

<p>"He asked me about Franz."</p>

<p>"What did you tell him?" said Franz.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing&mdash;I only said you sold horses; and
sometimes brandy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might have let that alone, youngster," muttered
Franz, looking a little annoyed; while the
others laughed.</p>

<p>"What said you of me, my little man?" inquired
Father Joachim, without pausing from his writing.</p>

<p>"What <em>could</em> I say, father, but that you were
Father Joachim, of the Capuchin convent at
Brixen, and that we all loved your reverence dearly?"
said Johann.</p>

<p>"You told him my name, then," muttered Father
Joachim.</p>

<p>"Did you say anything of Rudolf, Johann?" said
Theresa softly, with a little pull at her brother's
hair.</p>

<p>"I said he was a goodish sort of a fellow," said
Johann doggedly; "and that I believed he came
here to look after <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>"I'll pay you for it!" whispered she indignantly;
and giving him a little push, she hastily
went out; Rudolf furtively looking after her.</p>

<p>"My little lad," said the Capuchin gently, "you
must learn more discretion, or you will be a child
all your life. Well, Hofer, I think these will be
enough?"</p>

<p>"Enough and to spare," said the Sandwirth;
"with God's blessing."</p>

<p>"Children, let us ask it."</p>

<p>Every knee was bent in prayer, while Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Joachim fervently invoked the aid of the God of
battles. This concluded the conference. Solemnized,
and with burning hearts, they retired to rest; while
the Bavarian traveller carried the very little he knew
to the best market for it.</p>

<p>A lovely April morning succeeded this eventful
night. Scarcely had the sun begun to gild the
mountain-tops, when Theresa stood beside the river
with her milk-pail on her head, inquiring of Rudolf,
who was fishing in the shade, how many trout he
had caught for Father Joachim's breakfast.</p>

<p>Carrying a pail or pitcher on the head gives the
neck an erect, noble carriage&mdash;reining it up, as it
were: and Theresa, in her short, scanty grass-green
petticoat, and black bodice laced with scarlet, might
have stood for the Princess Nausicaa, as her laughing
black eyes looked down on the young fisherman
from beneath their long lashes.</p>

<p>"There's a wary fellow under that yellow stone,"
answered Rudolf; "I caught a gleam, just now, of
his bright back-fin."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you did&mdash;I dare say it was only
the water that sparkled. I would undertake to milk
all the cows in the Passeyrthal, before you caught
fish enough for dinner."</p>

<p>"Try me," said he, leaning back on his elbow to
look up full at her. "Though I have but a four-acre
farm, it's in full cultivation, quite productive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
enough for you and me, with a good wooden cottage
on it, too. I'll catch you a fish for dinner every day."</p>

<p>"What nonsense, Rudolf, you do talk!"</p>

<p>"No nonsense at all. I'm quite in earnest; but
you do love to cut up a poor fellow."</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Theresa, looking down, though
she could not bend her head. "Shall you come to
the shooting-match on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"To be sure I shall. The match will be only a
feint."</p>

<p>"Do you like the prospect of war?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;Don't you?"</p>

<p>"If my father does not get hurt, nor&mdash;nor one or
two friends&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Martin Teimer, I suppose."</p>

<p>"What care I for Martin Teimer?"</p>

<p>"Franz Raffel, then!"</p>

<p>"Rudolf, how <em>can</em> you be so stupid?"</p>

<p>"Speckbacher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly, for one. We all love dear Speckbacher."</p>

<p>"Theresa! What wild tales they tell of him!
They say that, being early left his own master, it soon
ceased to be sufficient excitement to him to follow
the roe or wage war with the lammergeyer from
morning to-night, in the most savage, inaccessible
places, so that he at length left his home altogether,
and joined a set of lawless companions who dwelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
among the caverns; supporting himself with his
rifle when it was successful, but at other times joining
predatory parties into the Bavarian dominions."</p>

<p>"Something I have heard of this," said Theresa,
in a low voice; "but Maria Schmeider reclaimed
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he was checked by the sudden and terrible
end of one of his companions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At any rate, he has been one of the best of
husbands, and most honest of men, ever since he
married; and their little cottage at Rinn is the
scene of perfect happiness&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is a touch of romance in him, still, however.
Franz told me just now, as we returned from
mass, that on their road yesterday, through thunder
and lightning, Speckbacher gave him such wonderful
descriptions of the salt caverns near Halle, that it
seemed like a fairy tale."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Theresa. "I have heard him
speak of them to my father, and say how he should
delight to take him through them. My father liked
the idea, but I confess it would make me shudder. All
sunlight is excluded; you begin by plunging down
three hundred steps that seem as though conducting
you to the very centre of the earth; the red light of
your torch falls on murky subterranean lakes,
beneath towering walls of sparkling salt. How
horrible, should one fall into one of those lakes!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Speckbacher says there are no fewer than forty-eight
caverns, and that some of the galleries connecting
them are three leagues in length. He called
it a capital place for hide and seek."</p>

<p>"Aye, or for storing brandy, as that scamp Franz
said," muttered Rudolf.</p>

<p>"Much obliged," said Franz, sauntering up.
"Hope I'm no interruption."</p>

<p>"None at all," said Rudolf, watching his trout.</p>

<p>"Listeners never hear good of themselves," said
Theresa tartly.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were talking secrets, or I
wouldn't have intruded," said Franz, throwing
himself on the grass. "So I'm a scamp, am I?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry I used the word, and that's
truth," said the good-natured Rudolf.</p>

<p>"I suppose you think it, though," said Franz,
jerking a stone into the river.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't trouble the water!" cried Theresa,
hastily. "How can you be such a spoil-sport?"</p>

<p>"Spoil-sport, am I?" said Franz doggedly.
"Well, perhaps I am. Now I know my titles and
designations. Franz Scamp Spoil-sport."</p>

<p>"Better take care not to deserve them, then,"
said Theresa pettishly. "If you stay out here much
longer, we shall breakfast without you."</p>

<p>And pitching her voice, which was both sweet and
clear, rather high, she went towards the house,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
singing one of the popular national airs in praise of
liberty.</p>

<p>Franz followed the songstress into the house;
and Rudolf, who, having exchanged his worm for a
smaller one, (for trout loathe large baits,) was just
going to try his luck again when little Johann,
running up to him, and looking on for a minute with
very round eyes, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, you mustn't do that!&mdash;Why, that's
father's pet trout, that feeds out of his hand and
weighs fifteen pounds! Why, that trout has lived
under that stone twenty-eight years! Father'll be
finely angry with you, I can tell you, if you think of
eating that trout! Why, he'd as soon eat me!"</p>

THE SHOOTING MATCH.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">S</span>UNDAY afternoon presented a busy scene at the
<i>wirth-haus</i>. Groups of gaily-dressed peasants
were standing about, many talking fast and eagerly,
others quietly, and a little apart. Here stood a woman
in an extinguisher-shaped black worsted cap, with her
massive arms akimbo, talking to another apparently
strong enough to build a house, who wore a globular
cap of fur; while, between them, stood a third in a
grass-green gown, very short-waisted, and with three
rows of red binding round the skirt, her head covered
by a gaudy handkerchief, tied under the chin. They
looked worthy compatriots of the women of the Vorarlberg,
who, during the Thirty Years' War, drove a
Swedish division out of the Lechthal, and killed
them to a man. There was more of the lioness that
might be roused to defend her cubs, in them, however,
than of the <i>poissarde</i>; they had hard hands,
strong arms, kind hearts, and firm wills.</p>

<p>The young girls, who were mostly sunburnt, and
pleasant-looking rather than pretty, had bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
considerable attention on their hair, which was
braided in long shining tails, tied with gay ribands,
and surmounted in some cases by jaunty little straw
hats, rather bigger than daisies, and wreathed with
primroses, blue hyacinths, and anemones. Among
the young men and lads, red sashes, green jackets,
and blue stockings were rife; each had his tall,
conical hat with gold cord and tassels, flower, or
feather; his rifle, plated buckles, and flower in his
button-hole. They did not seem to have much to
say to the young girls, for flirtation is very little
countenanced in the Tyrol.</p>

<p>The target was set up at a distance of two hundred
and fifty paces. There were the benches, the beer-tables,
and the long board on tressels, covered with
balls, powder-flasks, and everything likely to be
wanted for the sport. The rifles that were to do
such goodly service were heavy and clumsy, with
triggers so delicate as almost to be set off by a gust
of wind. Theresa actively assisted her mother in
waiting on the company. Johann sidled up to little
Anderl Speckbacher and got him off to a bank, where
they could watch the shooting, their arms round
each other's necks. The two little girls held their
mother's apron as long as they could, and finally
found themselves some juvenile companions.</p>

<p>Franz was very smart; but, somehow, his clothes
always looked as if they had been made for some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>body
else; and were worn with a slouching air, as if
he felt too fine for his company. On the other hand,
Rudolf's glossy suit of green velveteen fitted without
a crease, and he did not seem to think either of
himself or his dress, but to have alert, disengaged
attention for whatever was going on.</p>

<p>Talking to Hofer and Speckbacher was a man of
thirty, with piercing blue eyes, a bold but not prepossessing
countenance, indicative of great sharpness,
and stooping a little, neither like a mountaineer
nor a soldier, though he had been a militia captain
and major. This was Martin Teimer, who had come
from Clagenfurt to talk over the rising with his compatriots.
He had been appointed by General
Chastelar, chief of the peasants of the Upper
Innthal, and seemed rather inclined, his two companions
thought, to plume himself on it. These
three men had an eye to everything that was going
on around them; and now and then separated
and mingled among the groups, speaking to men
here and there, till, in time, they had had a short
private colloquy with every man on the ground;
returning to each other from time to time, and comparing
notes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the rifles were in full action: now
circle one, now circle two was hit, now the bull's
eye; and even without looking round, it was easy to
tell by the cheerful, the triumphant, or the moderated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
acclamations, what had been the rifleman's
success.</p>

<p>Speckbacher, returning from one of these progresses,
observed to Hofer, "I don't much like that
youth, Franz Raffel; he is shallow, vain-glorious,
and given to talk. He would be better among the
châlets."</p>

<p>"Thither he shall go, if we can get him," said
Hofer; "but he is somewhat slippery to get hold of;
half his time, he is skulking about, smuggling brandy
across the frontier; and as we want a good store of
it just now, I at present make him useful."</p>

<p>"Rudolf is worth a score of him," said Speckbacher;
"and I think your pretty Theresa thinks so
too. I would not discourage that youngster, Anderl,
even if Martin Teimer were to come forward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of a surety, no," said Hofer, quietly. "The
lad is a good lad. We shall see what stuff he is
made of this summer; and, if he quits himself well,
he shall have Theresa at the end of it. You and I
were little more than two-and-twenty when we took
our brides to church; and Theresa is already nearly
as old as her mother was. But we have other matters
in hand just now. I see one or two together whom
I want to speak to, only Franz is within earshot of
them. Do you draw him off."</p>

<p>Speckbacher immediately went up to him, and
asked whether he could let him have some brandy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and Hofer joined a couple of elderly men, who were
just sitting down side by side on a bench under a
tree.</p>

<p>"There hasn't been such a match as this a good
while," one was saying; "but, dear me, what matches
we used to have when I was a lad! I'm not more
than fifteen or twenty years older than that marksman
who is taking aim now, but I don't believe
he'll hit the white. Crack! Well, they're making
a piece of work about it&mdash;I suppose he's hit the
bull's eye."</p>

<p>"Here comes one that can do more than that,"
said the other. "Anderl! you have not shot, to-day."</p>

<p>"Boys' play," said Hofer with indifference.</p>

<p>"But you could show them what a man can do."</p>

<p>"Brag, neighbours? No good of brag. Besides,
these lads shoot well, many of them. There was
some good shooting before you came."</p>

<p>"People always say that of everything," said the
other. "I've no spirit for these things now."</p>

<p>"Ah, things will befall shortly, that will put you
in spirits."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Sandwirth? Is anything going
to happen?"</p>

<p>Hofer nodded.</p>

<p>The two men put their heads close to his, and
looked eager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall rise, soon."</p>

<p>"<em>Rise?</em> What, the Tyrol?"</p>

<p>Another nod.</p>

<p>"Under whom?"</p>

<p>"Nobody in particular. All of us under God."</p>

<p>They lifted up their hands and eyes.</p>

<p>"But is it certain? How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Of some one that knows. Quite certain."</p>

<p>"<i>Himmel!</i>&mdash;Did you get us together to-day to
tell us this?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"'Tis time!" cried one of the men in an impassioned
under-tone. "Why should we be turned
over from one master to another like a flock of
sheep? How did the King of Bavaria guarantee
our ancient rights and usages? With a piece of
sheepskin. None of his promises have been kept:
our representative States have been suppressed, our
public funds seized, our Church property confiscated;
and, as though this were not enough, taxes have
been imposed upon us. The Emperor is afraid of
France; but are <em>we</em>?"</p>

<p>"Not one of us, as we shall presently show
them," said Hofer. "Buonaparte is already in the
field against our Emperor, but we shall be quickly
down upon him. Communications have been
opened with the Archduke John, who is immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
going to effect a powerful diversion. Troops are
about to march to our assistance."</p>

<p>"Why, neighbour, if you were to speak this out,
every Tyrolese would rise directly!"</p>

<p>"True; but the moment, though close at hand, is
not quite come. In a day or two, perhaps, you will
receive a little billet inscribed '<cite>'Tis time</cite>'&mdash;the
whole country will be up directly!"</p>

<p>"Come, I'll try <em>my</em> hand at the rifle this moment!"
cried the old man, throwing aside his stick,
and hastening towards the crowd. He was known
and respected&mdash;they made way for him.</p>

<p>"Old Spickbart is going to try a shot!" cried
Franz to Rudolf&mdash;"What sport! I'll bet you a
quart of brandy he don't hit the target at all!"</p>

<p>The good man's hand shook so that his ball only
hit the outer circle.</p>

<p>"I'll try again," said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, do," said the Sandwirth kindly; and looking
round him as he spoke. There was not a smile,
except on the face of Franz.</p>

<p>"You and I used often to shoot together," said
Hofer. "Now then. Don't be in a hurry."</p>

<p>This time Spickbart hit the bull's eye. He was
much applauded, and looked greatly elated.</p>

<p>"Ah, I thought I could!" said he, wagging his
head. "The fault was only in my hand; not in
my eye.&mdash;Now, you, Hofer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," said Hofer.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, Sandwirth! Please, Sandwirth!" cried
many voices.</p>

<p>"You silly boys," said he, looking about for his own
rifle; "what do you want me to play with you for?"</p>

<p>A feather from some hat lay at his feet. He
picked it up and gave it to Rudolf.</p>

<p>"There, go and hold it up fifty paces beyond the
target."</p>

<p>"Rather you than me," said Franz with a shrug,
as Rudolf walked off.</p>

<p>"I'm not a bit afraid," said Rudolf.</p>

<p>He had no need to be. Crack went the rifle;
puff went the feather. There it lay, in two little
fragments; Rudolf's finger and thumb unhurt.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that was the coolest thing!" ejaculated
Franz, as the hills rang with acclamations.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's cool enough, that lad; without any
brag," said Hofer, quietly putting down his piece.</p>

<p>"Franz was not thinking of <em>him</em>," said Speckbacher,
grasping his friend's hand.</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em>," said Hofer softly. "I've tested the
boy."</p>

<p>Speckbacher gave him a quick look.</p>

<p>"He stood fire well."</p>

<p>"Yes, and expects no notice taken of it. Did it
never occur to you that William Tell's little son was
as brave as William Tell?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never till this minute! Do you hear that,
Anderl?"</p>

<p>Speckbacher's little son pressed his hand, and
then stroked it, looking up in his father's face.</p>

<p>"I should not have minded having the apple set
on my head for <em>you</em> to shoot at, father."</p>

<p>"Would not you, my little boy?" And Speckbacher's
brown hand fondly stroked the boy's brown
curls.</p>

<p>The sun was now nearly set. Hofer, as the best
shot, was carried round the ground, with flags, songs,
and garlands; and another target added as a trophy
to those on his already honoured walls. He and
Speckbacher had pretty well ascertained whom they
could depend on; a few more earnest words spoken,
and they were all on their way to their homes.</p>

<p>Hofer re-entered the house, with his hand on
Rudolf's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Here's a young fellow, now," said he cheerfully
to his wife, "who had faith that I would not blow
his right hand to pieces, and disable him for life,
just out of brag."</p>

<p>"Of course you would not, Sandwirth," said
Rudolf. "What good would it have done you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, my boy, I might have attempted something
I could not achieve!"</p>

<p>"You? No! you'll never do that."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope not. How well everything has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
gone off to-day! I am so glad Spickbart hit the
bull's eye."</p>

<p>"I am so glad you hit the feather," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was nothing in that. Poor Spickbart
is getting in years, and a little shaky; but
there's a man's true spirit in him yet."</p>

<p>"What a bustle and noise there has been; I'm
glad it's over."</p>

<p>"So am I, Anna. But it has been a very important
meeting."</p>

<p>"A few of the girls wanted to get up a dance;
but I knew that would never do."</p>

<p>"You were quite right. Let us dance when the
day is won, not before."</p>

<p>"Art weary, man?"</p>

<p>"A little, dear. Open a fresh bottle of beer."</p>

<p>She did, and sat down close opposite to him, looking
at him affectionately with her large brown eyes.</p>

<p>Rudolf and Theresa were talking in low, lover-like
tones, at the door, under covert of the balustraded
gallery. The young ones were at play.</p>

<p>Franz presently lounged in.</p>

<p>"I'm going now, Sandwirth," said he, approaching
Hofer, whose hand was locked in his wife's.
"Any commands?"</p>

<p>"Only about the brandy."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we talked that over before. You shall
have it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"What impression has this day made on you,
Franz?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;it's been very hot, for the time of year."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of the weather. Have you
had a pleasant afternoon's sport?"</p>

<p>"Well, no&mdash;there was too much business mixed
up with it. Sport is one thing, and business another.
Besides, I only hit the bull's eye twice, and Rudolf hit
it five times; whereas, the last time, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I remember."</p>

<p>"So that, altogether, you see&mdash;No, it was a poor
match, I call it. Sport's sport, and business is
business; isn't it, Sandwirth?"</p>

<p>"I can't gainsay that. Well, Franz, I'm afraid
you don't look forward with much pleasure to a
busy campaign this summer."</p>

<p>"I hope to do my duty as well as other people,"
said Franz, looking down. "What must be done,
must. Of course, we shall none of us like it."</p>

<p>"Do you call that speaking like a bold, hearty
young man? Why, you ought to rouse up at the
sound of the war trump!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course; so I do."&mdash;yawning.</p>

<p>"Thou'rt sleepy, lad," said Anna, rather contemptuously.</p>

<p>"No, I'm quite awake," said Franz.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Sandwirth, "there will be plenty
of different kinds of work to do this summer; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that all people's tastes may be suited. There will
be plenty of fighting; those who are active and
stirring, and fond of their country, will like that.
There will be plenty of message-carrying from one
post to another; this will be attended with occasional
risk, and will require much activity and dexterity,
and will be equally honourable and useful
with the other. There will be plenty of hard labour,
felling trees, rolling stones, making barricades, carrying
ammunition up precipitous heights; this will
be as useful as the others: plenty of night-watching;
this will be fatiguing rather than dangerous, and as
useful as the others. Then, while so many are away
from their herds and their flocks, some will be absolutely
needed to look after the stock; and these will
be as useful as the others. Which of all these
various posts will best suit your fancy?"</p>

<p>"Well, that requires consideration," said Franz,
pulling a wooden stool to the table, and sitting down
opposite to Hofer. "Let me see. First, there's
fighting. You know, Sandwirth, that I've dealt so
long in foreign brandy, that I know a little what
danger is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course; and therefore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And therefore, if I don't choose fighting, people
can't say I'm afraid. Can they, now?"</p>

<p>"Whether they can or no, is little to the
purpose."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just so. Well, then; as to the message-carrying;
that, as you say, is useful, but dangerous; to
which I may add vexatious."</p>

<p>"I don't know why it need be."</p>

<p>"Don't you? Why, I look upon it as one of
the most plaguy, uninteresting, abasing employments
a fellow can undertake; and without getting any
credit by it."</p>

<p>"Let it pass, then. There are plenty whom it
will suit very well."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! Well, then, let me see. What comes
next? Oh, manual labour. Felling trees, and so
forth. Do you know, Sandwirth, my mother asked
me, last Christmas, to chop up a billet of wood for
the fire, and I hit myself such a blow on the left
hand with the axe,&mdash;here, just at the fleshy part of
the thumb,&mdash;that I carry the mark of it, as you may
see, to this day. And my mother said it <em>might</em> have
brought on lock-jaw!"</p>

<p>"Did she, though?"</p>

<p>"Death in three days," said Franz solemnly.
"These handicraft jobs, you see, require practice.
They amount almost to trades. Now, a trade requires
an apprenticeship; and I've never had one to
a woodcutter: so that, altogether, I might do myself
more hurt than anybody else."</p>

<p>"Many people do."</p>

<p>"That's considered then. Well, what comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
next? Night-watching. Oh, yes, I would not at
all mind taking my turn at that, though I'm a
dreadful one for falling asleep."</p>

<p>"A sleepy sentinel would not be of much use."</p>

<p>"No; only everybody must sleep sometimes;
and they that work hardest sleep soundest."</p>

<p>"Just so."</p>

<p>"As for carrying provisions up the hills, little
chaps like your Johann are equal to that, I think."</p>

<p>"I should hope so."</p>

<p>"&mdash;Which they are not with regard to looking
after stock. That's a man's business. As you said,
it's just as useful and honourable as the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I said useful, though not honourable,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you didn't <em>say</em> it, you know&mdash;I knew what
you meant. And it isn't every one that understands
stock, or would be for taking the trouble of it."</p>

<p>"No, indeed! You're quite right there."</p>

<p>"So that, as I <em>do</em> understand it, and don't mind
the trouble of it,&mdash;why, to oblige <em>you</em>, I'll undertake
it."</p>

<p>"Thank you heartily, Franz! You will indeed
oblige me very much!"</p>

<p>"Come, that's cordial!" said Franz, as Hofer
held out his hand to him. "I'm quite glad I've
decided as I have."</p>

<p>"So am I. I hoped you would get round to it,
but did not know how to propose it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I'll do it; and do it well. Bless you! you
mightn't have had a head of cattle left!"</p>

<p>"And then where should we be?"</p>

<p>"There's no knowing," said Franz, with a sapient
shake of the head. "Well, good night."</p>

<p>The voices at the door had been perfectly silent
during this dialogue; and Hofer had once or twice
heard a stifled laugh.</p>

<p>Franz, however, pre-occupied, and quite self-satisfied
with what he considered a masterly piece
of tactics, walked off.</p>

<p>"What a deal of trouble that young fellow has
saved me, to be sure!" muttered Hofer. Then,
raising his voice, "Now, then, dear children, come
in and sing the vesper hymn."</p>

WOLFSTHRUN.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ERCHED on a certain height not far from
Sterzing, stands a certain old castle, one of
the many that crest the Tyrolese mountains, and
which, on investigation, too often disappoint the
traveller by proving either desolate ruins, or garrisoned
to overflowing by Austrian soldiers. But
the castle in question was both habitable and inhabited;
a good and even luxurious breakfast was
spread in the lofty hall, which combined the adjuncts
of modern civilization with the romantic architecture
of feudal times; and a fine-looking military
man, perhaps turned fifty, sat reading despatches,
while his daughter, a young lady of eighteen, poured
out coffee for him and a young cavalry officer, who
was already attacking the potted game.</p>

<p>"This seems an admirable proclamation of the
Archduke's," said the Baron, at length throwing
aside his papers and beginning his breakfast. "You
will soon have plenty to do, Gerhardi."</p>

<p>"I hope we may," said Colonel Gerhardi. "Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
just and numerous complaints will lie before the
tribunal of the world. The Archduke calls it a
holy war, and so do I. So great a power as Napoleon
Buonaparte's cannot be opposed alone, and
therefore all the nations ought to make common
cause against him."</p>

<p>"Ought and will are two things," said Baron
Sternach drily. "I should embark in this war with
much more readiness than I do, if I saw our way
safely and victoriously out of it; but if, after a fruitless
though brilliant struggle, we are reduced to
make inglorious conditions of peace, it would have
been better to leave the matter alone."</p>

<p>"Ah, papa, don't throw cold water on us!" cried
Hildegarde. "Why should not we be the liberators
of Europe? As soon as the rising once takes
place, I know you will take part in it as warmly as
any."</p>

<p>"Certainly; for the danger of the brave is
always less than that of the coward; even if duty
and discipline have no influence. My only fear is
lest we rush hastily into an unconsidered struggle
with a foe whose power, hitherto, nothing has been
able to withstand."</p>

<p>"The tables will turn on him, some day, sir,
you'll see," said Colonel Gerhardi.</p>

<p>"I hope I may see it. All we have to do, just
now, is to obey our superior in command; and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
gives the word to advance. Did you ever chance to
see Hofer?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Baron; I have seen him twice. He was
one of the peasant deputies to the States once, I
think? A plain, homely, honest-hearted fellow,
seemingly. We didn't think much of him."</p>

<p>"Not as much, perhaps, as he deserved. I saw
him in the year 1805, when he was chosen from his
native valley as deputy to the Archduke John;
which showed that the Tyrolese already looked upon
him with considerable confidence, though he could
not have been much turned of thirty. And he was
summoned again by the Archduke, you know, to
Vienna, this January, which shows that he saw some
ground of reliance in him."</p>

<p>"As a matter-of-fact witness, I should suppose,
Baron. He would tell the Archduke exactly what
was the state of popular feeling, and how many
fighting men could be depended on, without the
least hesitation or exaggeration. I conclude him to
be a man of strict truth; who would neither speak
disparagingly of a rival, nor praise him insincerely
to curry favour. This struck me with regard to
what he said of Martin Teimer. Hormayr put it to
him closely: was Teimer a reliable man, or was he
not? Hofer spoke very briefly of him; he would
not dispraise him, even by an inuendo: neither
would he say more in his praise than he felt. Baron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Hormayr noticed this to us afterwards, as if Hofer
were jealous of him; but I did not think him so.
I thought he spoke the simple truth."</p>

<p>"And few there be that speak it," said the Baron.
"Well, we shall soon see what is in them both.
Hormayr is a sensible, gentlemanlike man, and good
officer."</p>

<p>"A little wanting in ardour, don't you think,
Baron?"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh, you young fellows have too much.
You think to carry things by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>."</p>

<p>"That's what Buonaparte did, sir, many times in
Italy. We were continually too slow for him."</p>

<p>"Well, well, we shall not be, now. We begin
to-morrow; and that is near enough at hand even
for <em>you</em>, I should think."</p>

<p>"You are not afraid of leaving my cousin here,
Baron?"</p>

<p>"Why should I be? Women and children will
be respected. I mean her and her aunt to be very
useful to us; for I expect that this empty old castle
will be filled with wounded men, and Hildegarde
must tend them like the heroines of old song."</p>

<p>"Ah, that I gladly will," cried Hildegarde. "As
soon as you and Adolph ride off, I shall summon the
servants, tell them what is to be expected, and
superintend their immediate preparations for the
reception of the sick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"The strong-rooms and dungeons must be looked
to also," said the Baron; "for we may expect many
prisoners."</p>

<p>"Ah, papa! don't put any of them down into
those dark holes full of newts and toads, only fit
for the barbarous times!"</p>

<p>"Certainly not; but we must provide for their
security, nevertheless, or they may seize the castle
and put <em>you</em> into one of the dark holes, instead."</p>

<p>"Ugh!&mdash;I am sure I should not live through the
night! My hair would turn quite white. Why,
Adolph, you have no idea what terrible stories are
told of those dungeons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Old wives' tales&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>True</em> tales. Bones have been found. Human
hair sticking to the wall. Stains of blood!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, we are not going to repeat those
things. You may pet your prisoners as much as
you like, so long as you do not let them run away,
nor run away with them."</p>

<p>"With <em>one</em> of them, papa, I suppose you meant
to say. Well, I accept your <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte-blanche</i>; but you
must leave me the cellar-key."</p>

<p>"To treat the captive knight like the fair,
Saracen?"</p>

<p>"Sick men require wine, papa. And I must
have beef and mutton, and bread and beer, in unlimited
quantities, for those who are well."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, Hildegarde, as my fortune is not unlimited,
I see it will be to my interest to effect a
very speedy exchange of prisoners&mdash;if the enemy
have the good luck to make any. But here are we
reckoning on the captured and wounded before the
battle is fought!"</p>

<p>And, hastily despatching his breakfast, the Baron
collected his papers together, and went away to give
various orders.</p>

<p>"I hope the campaign will be a short and a brilliant
one," said Hildegarde anxiously. "I shall so
long for papa to return."</p>

<p>"My mother will soon join you," said Adolph.
"But if you are in the least fear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no! All my fears are for him; I have none
for myself. There is nothing I shall more gladly do
than help to nurse the poor men who have been
wounded in fighting for our liberties. Terrible
gashes and amputations, indeed, I do not feel quite
equal to. If we could get a medical man to remain
in the castle,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why should not you? Some of the Capuchins
are very clever. Father Joachim Haspinger has
been an army chaplain, and is preparing for service
again. He is as good, I am told, at setting a limb
as at breaking a head. His reputation and influence
among the peasantry are immense. What a pleasant
day that was, Hildegarde, when we visited the
Capuchin convent at Brixen!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and, do you know, we had another very
pleasant excursion in the Passeyrthal after you had
rejoined your regiment. A storm came on, and we
took refuge in Hofer's Inn, <i>am Sand</i>. We did not
see him; but his wife and pretty daughter were
very attentive to us.&mdash;Ah! the horses are coming
round," said Hildegarde, interrupting herself; and
her eyes filled with tears as her father returned to
take leave of her; but she brushed them away, and
kissed him with a smile. She accompanied them to
the gate.</p>

"'TIS TIME."</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ING-DONG, ding-dong! Clang!&mdash;go the
little and great church bells. Bang! go the
cannon; crack, crack! the rifles. The Tyrol is up!</p>

<p>The night of the eighth of April was dark and
gloomy. General Chastelar and Baron Hormayr
passed it in riding through the Austrian troops to
give the necessary orders for the intended movement,
and to see that everything was in a state of
preparation. The stillness which reigned around
was only broken by the measured tramp of many
feet, the hollow rattle of artillery, the lumbering of
ammunition-wagons, and now and then a clear-toned
voice issuing a brief order.</p>

<p>Hofer and Martin Teimer, during this wakeful
night, were busy in the Sandwirth's kitchen, drawing
up a general order to this effect:&mdash;</p>

<p>"On the 11th of April General Chastelar will
arrive at Innsbruck, and General Hiler at Brixen.</p>

<p>"The Archduke John directs the men of Pusterthal
to occupy the pass of Mulbach, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Rittnern that of the Kuntersweg, that we may be
possessed of the strongest position before the Bavarians
are alarmed, and attempt to fly from Brixen to
Botzen.</p>

<p>"Kolbe, by order of the Archduke, is to command
at Kuntersweg, take charge of prisoners, and
protect the persons and papers of those Bavarian
officers who have been distinguished for their inveteracy
against the Austrian government and the
Tyrol from all injury and ill-treatment; but on no
pretence to allow them to proceed from Ritten to
Botzen. At Kaltern Joseph Morandel is chosen
commander by the Archduke, and has received
orders what to do. Count Arzt commands at
Nonsburg, and Baron Hormayr is Commissary-General.</p>

<p>"Given at Sand, in Passeyr, on the 9th of April,
1809.</p>

<p class="firma uni">
"<span class="smcap">Martin Teimer</span>,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Andrew Hofer</span>, <i>Publican</i>."<br />
</p>

<p>While it was yet dark, Teimer was hastening over
the mountains to Oberinthal, to join the Austrians;
and Hofer to the muster-ground of the men of
Passeyr, appointed on the shooting-match day.
With dawning light, the eagerly-watching peasants,
lower down the rivers, saw sawdust floating on the
surface of the Passeyr and the Inn, and understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the signal; while, among the hills and mountains,
billets, inscribed "'Tis time!" flew from hand to
hand, from house to house, like the fiery cross: and
men hastily caught up their rifles, buckled on their
shot-belts, and poured forth.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the morning the Austrian
advanced guard was in motion. Chastelar and
Hormayr harangued their troops, inciting them to
ardour; and before the march had lasted a couple
of hours, the thunder of distant guns and the tumultuous
din of alarm-bells resounded through the
valleys. Innumerable fires were discovered on the
heights; and as Chastelar's division advanced up
the Drauthal, thousands of men, women, and
children came forth to meet it, waving green boughs,
and pressing forwards to kiss the hands and even the
feet of their deliverers. The force consisted, in all,
of sixteen battalions of foot, and three squadrons of
horse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hofer, at the head of five thousand
strong, was crossing the Jauffen, to intercept the
enemy between Brixen and the Brenner.</p>

<p>On reaching the muster-ground, a succession of
short, abrupt, hearty cheers had greeted him. He
said little more than "Are we all ready, brothers?
Then no time is to be lost;" but his look was as
gay as a bridegroom's, and they started forth like
guests hurrying to a wedding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing the little village of St. Leonard, they
struck up to the old Castle of Jauffen; and then
began to climb a steep and stony path resembling
the dry bed of a torrent, being strewn with boulders;
shaded here and there with walnuts and budding
elders. Presently the path ran along a precipitous
slope, high above the valley, and occasionally
crossing chasms on most insecure-looking bridges of
poles, carelessly laid across, that required Tyrolean
nerves to tread in confidence. These men thought
nothing whatever about it, unless the idea occurred
how easily they could pull the loose poles after them
if the enemy were behind.</p>

<p>The last village on their ascent was Walten. Up
to this point they had chatted and occasionally sung
a verse or two of some patriotic song; but now they
must husband their breath; there would not be
another rood of level ground. Now pastures, now
fir-woods, here and there a lonely cottage, but still
ascending. They get beyond the straggling pines, to
bare, thin turf, with the rock frequently forcing itself
through it. Here and there are cool, bubbling
springs, at which many slake their thirst.</p>

<p>Poles, to guide the winter traveller, are next
reached; then, a tall cross, in passing which each
man reverently crosses himself. And now they are
on the topmost ridge.</p>

<p>They look around from their seven thousand feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
elevation with a feeling of satisfaction. This is not
the Jauffen, but above it; the amphitheatre of rocky
peaks around and below them, and the wild glaciers
of the Oetzthal and Stubagerthal, are familiar to them
all; yet not so much so as to have lost their power
of impressing the imagination. They stand a few
minutes, silent and serious, in the felt presence of
the God who made the mountains. The Tyrolese
are deeply religious: the scenes around them continually
bring them into communion with the God
of nature; and the perils by which they are environed,
as constantly remind them of their dependence
on the God of redemption.</p>

<p>Onward again they go, down to a turfy little level
where Hofer bids them halt. It is now nearly
noon; each man has brought a rye-cake or two;
they make their frugal meal, and drink water from
the spring. Hofer has a bottle of beer, which he
shares as far as it will go.</p>

<p>After this temperate repast, the five thousand
resume their march. Among the firs once more;
then another rude cross; then a little oratory in
the rock, with a carved and painted representation
of the Saviour on the crucifix in a railed recess, with
seats and kneeling benches in front. Still downwards
leads their path, towards Sterzinger Moss,
between banks covered with wild strawberry
blossoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Hereabouts they fell in with several peasants from
the neighbourhood of Mauls and Mittelwald, who
seemed in great excitement. Hofer immediately
stepped on to meet them. "What is going forward,
brothers?" cried he.</p>

<p>"Much," replied one of them eagerly. "A French
column has taken possession of the bridge of Laditch,
and the Bavarians have seized the bridge of St.
Lorenzen. Both are being furiously contested for,
and it would be well if we could get up with them
in time to be of assistance to our men at either
place; but here is another detachment of Bavarians
close upon us."</p>

<p>"Never mind; we'll beat them first, and help
the others afterwards."</p>

<p>"Are you Hofer's men?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is, I am Hofer. We are all brethren.
Where are the Bavarians?"</p>

<p>"In the Valley of the Eisach. They are this side
Sterzing already."</p>

<p>"All the better! Never fear!"</p>

<p>"Fear! Certainly not&mdash;even our women and
girls are not afraid. See, they are driving our hay-wagons,
and singing and shouting as they come.
We could not wait for them, but they will soon be
up with us; and the wagons will afford us excellent
cover, with the advantage of height, for firing on the
enemy; besides being moveable barricades."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Capital! He was a clever fellow who thought
of it."</p>

<p>"A woman thought of it&mdash;my daughter Margaret!"</p>

<p>"Excellent!&mdash;Well, we have no time to lose."</p>

<p>"No, we shall see them directly. They are
under Colonel Dittfurt, who wants to join General
Kinkel."</p>

<p>"He shall not, if we can help it.&mdash;Brothers!
there is little to say. These two forces must be
prevented from meeting. One of them is close
upon us. Prepare for immediate action."</p>

<p>"They're coming!" screamed a woman, standing
up on the top of a wagon, piled high with hay;
and her little boy immediately hitting the horses
nearest him with a stick, they pulled forward with
a jerk which overset the woman on the hay, and
made some hundreds of men laugh. It has a curious
effect when a multitude of voices utter a "He-he-he!"</p>

<p>Hofer saw at once where to dispose the wagons
in the defile; not an unnecessary direction was
given, for he was ever a man of few words; often
a look, a gesture sufficed; and the Tyrolese obeyed
him as the Roman legion obeyed Cæsar in Britain&mdash;"<em>at
a word, and at the moment</em>."</p>

<p>Soon, those who were in the rear heard the crack
of rifles in front. It would seem as though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Bavarians were taken by surprise; for at first they
fell back, returning only a few scattered shot; but
presently they recovered themselves and began a
continuous fire of musketry. As the defile, however,
would only permit a small body of them to
enter it, their superiority of numbers was of no
advantage to them in a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>, and only
availed in filling up the ranks of those who were
constantly shot down. Four-fifths of their bullets
were wasted on rocks, trees, and brushwood; while
their ambuscaded foes, entrenched behind trusses
of hay, tree-stumps, and heaps of stones, securely
picked them off and hardly threw away a shot.</p>

<p>Margaret, quick-witted lass, danced and capered
at the top of her father's wagon, crying and almost
screaming, "Never mind the Bavarian smoke-pellets!"</p>

<p>Towards evening, a strong detachment of French
afforded a diversion in favour of the Bavarians, and
assailed the Tyrolese from the other end of the defile
by an incessant fire, for some time without effect.
At length, overpowered by numbers, they were
beginning to give way, when at this critical moment
Colonel Gerhardi, the "Adolph" who had
breakfasted at Wolfsthrun, appeared on the heights
with between two and three hundred light horse,
and immediately charged the enemy, shouting
loudly. In a few minutes the firing of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and Bavarians ceased; the Tyrolese uttered exclamations
of joy and thankfulness, some fell on their
knees to bless Heaven, while others cheered on their
allies.</p>

<p>The Bavarians retreated towards Sterzing, with
considerable loss of killed, wounded, and prisoners;
while the French division fled in the opposite direction.
Hofer and his men spent the night on the
heights; and with dawning day were again attacked
by the Bavarians, who rallied on Sterzinger Moss;
but the Tyrolese sharpshooters, sheltered by the
rocks, made dreadful havoc amongst them, and the
artillerymen were several times shot away from
their guns.</p>

<p>At length, the Tyrolese made a desperate charge,
armed with spears, pitchforks, scythes, axes, and
any implements they could muster; while others on
the verge of the heights, hurled down masses of
rock on their opponents. After some hours, the
Bavarians gave way; and having lost several of their
best officers and above two hundred and forty men
killed and wounded, threw down their arms and
surrendered.</p>

<p>The old castle of Wolfsthrun had been prepared,
as well as circumstances permitted, for the reception
of wounded men and prisoners, by Hildegarde Von
Sternach; and she was not a little glad that Adolph's
mother had already joined her, when a messenger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from him informed her that five hundred and eighty
prisoners were being brought up to the castle.</p>

<p>Hofer and his companions, like hungry men as
they were, were meantime devouring their remnant
of rye-cakes with abundance of Spartan sauce, and
slaking their thirst at the springs. At this moment,
Rudolf came panting up to Hofer, whom he had
found with no small difficulty.</p>

<p>"Sandwirth!" exclaimed he, "what a night you
must have had! So have we, but we kept possession
of the bridges; and General Chastelar opportunely
came up to us just as the French received reinforcements
from Mantua. You bade me let you know
how things were going, or I would not have left,
for the men of Innthal were about to attack them
in front, while the men of Whippthal fell on them
from the rear."</p>

<p>Another Tyrolese here came up, and said, "I've
been looking out along the Sterzing road, Sandwirth,
and met a man who told me that a strong force of
Bavarians is trying to reach Innsbruck, under
General Wrede; but the peasants swarm the rocks
and impede their march, having broken the bridges,
and blocked up the roads with felled trees. I am
sorry to add, that the Bavarians, being much exasperated,
are committing every sort of excess."</p>

<p>"No doubt of their being exasperated, brother,"
said Hofer. "May be, we should feel so in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
place; but since we see how ugly it is in them, do
not let us, who have not the same excuse, be
tempted to the smallest pillage, cruelty, or violence;
otherwise God will cease to bless us."</p>

<p>How fared it, meanwhile, with Speckbacher?
He was sharpening a coulter outside the stable of
his little cottage at Rinn, which stands amidst a
clump of larch and beech-trees; when Maria his
wife smilingly came up to him to show him that his
youngest infant had just cut its first tooth, and to
ask him if it did not remind him of a pearl upon a
rose-leaf. Just then, his rustic servant Zoppel put
a little slip of wood into his hand, bearing the inscription
roughly endorsed, "'Tis time!"</p>

<p>Down went the coulter; he kissed wife and infant,
and hurried into the house, followed, wherever he
went, by his little son Anderl, who wistfully eyed
him as he took up his rifle.</p>

<p>The last word having been spoken cheerily, Speckbacher
sped on his way, watched only for a minute
by Maria, who felt a tear glistening in her eye and
did not wish him to see it. So she re-entered the
house.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little boy ran after him.</p>

<p>"Father! let me go too!"</p>

<p>"You? you little rogue! No, no, not this time.
You must stay at home and take care of your
mother."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"But she doesn't want taking care of, father!&mdash;Besides,
there's Zoppel.&mdash;Do let me go!"</p>

<p>"When you are a bigger boy, you shall, I
promise you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there will be no fighting <em>then</em>."</p>

<p>"All the better."</p>

<p>"Please let me go, father!"</p>

<p>"What good could a little chap like you do?"</p>

<p>"Take care of you, father!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Capital! I hope to take care of
myself, dear boy."</p>

<p>"But, father, you want me to be brave, like you,
when I come to be a man. How can I be, unless
I look on, and see what brave men do?"</p>

<p>Speckbacher felt his throat swell. He turned
about, took the boy in his arms, lifted him up from
the ground, and kissed him several times.</p>

<p>"There," said he. "Go home now, like a good
boy. Another time."</p>

<p>There was a tear on the little boy's cheek as he
stood watching the retreating figure&mdash;a tear that had
not fallen from his own eyes. He brushed it off&mdash;looked
at it&mdash;and then trotted away into the brushwood;
from whence, as he kept running along, he
could get glimpses of his father, himself unseen.
Once he saw Speckbacher pause and look back;
perhaps to see if his little boy had obeyed him and
gone home. After that, he never looked back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
again; he pressed forward to the things that were
before him.</p>

<p>The young boy still went on; his short, quick
steps keeping pretty well up with his father's strides.
Children that walk much with their parents generally
step out well. Now and then he had to force
his way among the bushes, or go a little way round;
for which he made up afterwards by running. He
had no settled purpose, except just to keep his
father a little longer in sight.</p>

<p>At length he grew tired and thought he must give
up. Just then a man joined Speckbacher and
stopped him to speak to him, pointing towards
Halle. Anderl sat down and had a long rest.
When Speckbacher went on again, the little boy felt
refreshed, and was able to follow him with ease.
Presently some men came running down the hills by
various paths, and joined Speckbacher. They all
walked on very fast. Afterwards they reached a
vast body of men, who shouted when they saw
Speckbacher till the hills rang again. When he
came up to them they had a long parley, frequently
pointing towards Volders and Halle; and they
finished by all walking off together in that direction,
with Speckbacher at their head.</p>

<p>The little boy now thought he could not turn
back; it was too exciting to be resisted; and, as he
had now had a second good rest, he trotted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
again, keeping up with them as a little dog does with
a spirited horse.</p>

<p>By and by the men halted. They sat down on
the grass near a spring, and pulled out some rye-cakes
and began to eat. This was their supper.
The sun was going down, and they did not want to
fall on the Bavarians, in Volders, till dark. Anderl
did not know this. He was surprised, and a little
afraid, to find himself alone, so far from home,
when night was drawing on; but he never thought
of leaving his father. To look on and see some
thousand men eating while he was fasting, was
rather tantalizing; however, he did so very patiently;
and when, after a long rest, they renewed
their march, he saw one, who had been talking in
preference to eating, leave a rye-cake behind him.
As soon as they were sufficiently in advance, Anderl
ran down and seized the cake, pursuing his way
while he ate it.</p>

<p>The men were now getting among the trees, overhanging
a road, and moving stealthily so as not to
be easily seen. Anderl was startled by a church-clock
striking quite near him; and could imperfectly
make out white buildings here and there, a river,
and a bridge. Presently a discharge of fire-arms
was heard in advance. Some horsemen dashed
along the road, and were shot down. Others dashed
after them, and shared the same fate. Others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
again and again filled up the road, maintaining a fire
that would have been destructive had it not, as little
Anderl observed, been expended on bushes and
trees. Presently a bullet nearly hit him; only, <em>as it
did not</em>, he picked it up and put it in his pocket.
At last he had collected quite a little heap, regardless
of the shot that whistled round him.</p>

<p>By and by he observed that his father, towards
whom he had crept with the instinct of affection,
ceased firing, though the enemy was not yet silenced.
What could be the reason? It struck him that he
must have expended all his bullets; which, indeed,
was the case. So he ran up to him with his handkerchief,
which was now quite full of them, and
plucked him by the sleeve, saying, "Father, here
are some more to go on with."</p>

<p>It would have been worth a world to you to see
Speckbacher's start!</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> here?" said he, in amaze.</p>

<p>"Yes, father; I could not bear to lose sight of
you, so I kept running on till the firing began; and
then, when I saw how the Bavarians wasted their
bullets, I picked up as many as I could. If you'll
use these, father, I'll soon bring you some more."</p>

<p>Speckbacher could not speak. He caught him to
his heart, gave him a hug, held him there a moment,
and then set him down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"Off with you into cover, you young rogue,"
said he; "never mind any more bullets."</p>

<p>And, handing a few of them to a comrade who
stood close by, he said, with a choke in his voice,
"These will hit the mark, surely, considering how
they have been brought!"</p>

<p>That night Speckbacher and his companions
drove the Bavarians out of Volders. At daybreak
they were at the gates of Halle.</p>

THE FIRST SUCCESS.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE warm spring sun is shining on a valley
watered by more than one winding river, and
with green pastures dotted with cows and sheep
peacefully feeding. It is closed in by hills green to
their summits, with only a few patches of snow
in their hollows. Behind these soar craggy and
fearful rocks, above which wheel one or two vultures,
and high overhead the kingly eagle; who
perhaps discerns some human quarry in the depths
below. Dead bodies must certainly be lying here
and there in the gorges; for now and then carrion
crows, sated with their impure repast, rise slowly on
their flapping wings, and fly heavily away.</p>

<p>In the sunniest and prettiest part of the valley is
a little village of some dozen whitewashed huts, that
look clean and comfortable at a distance. The
village is surely deserted! not a creature seems in it
except an old purblind woman, sitting outside her
door on a stone; and she is straining her cracked
voice in vain efforts to make herself heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hannes!&mdash;Lenora!&mdash;Franz!" cries she, quite
in a rage: and then pausing, as if spent,&mdash;"Why
doesn't somebody answer? They've all gone away
and left me, I do believe! Here's a condition to
be in! Suppose now my clothes had caught fire, or
the French were to come, or a wolf, or an evil spirit&mdash;precious
help I should have! This is the way we
old folks are treated, as soon as ever we can't slave
for other people any longer. Hallo! some of you!
Am I to split my throat? You'll come home and
find me dead some of these days. Dear me! they
won't mind; it's no use spending my breath. The
village is asleep or dead, I think; I can hear a crow
caw a mile off!"</p>

<p>When the peevish old woman became quite quiet,
she heard a footstep slowly approaching her; and
presently a man lounged up to her.</p>

<p>"Why, Franz, that must be you!" cried she;
"I know your step, you always drag your feet along
the ground so."</p>

<p>"So would anybody's feet," said Franz, "if
they were as tired as I am."</p>

<p>"Why, what has tired you?&mdash;lying under a
hedge, watching the cows."</p>

<p>"Don't you go to believe, mother, I've been
wasting my time like <em>that</em>. The cows are competent
to take care of themselves."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"What have I been doing? Why, now, there's
a question! Why, the world's turned upside down,
I think; and you sit here, blinking in the sun, and
know nothing about it."</p>

<p>"How am I to know anything if you all run away
and leave me? What's happened?"</p>

<p>"What's happened! Why, Speckbacher has
taken Halle!"</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"&mdash;Has, though&mdash;That's one thing. When you've
given over disbelieving that, I'll tell you something
else."</p>

<p>"Well, say thy say, tiresome boy."</p>

<p>"Hofer's in Innsbruck!"</p>

<p>"The Sandwirth? What, prisoner?"</p>

<p>"Prisoner! No, mother, quite the other way.
We've turned out the Bavarians!"</p>

<p>"What, out of Innsbruck?"</p>

<p>"Aye, out of Innsbruck. Twenty thousand of us
got together on the heights about the city&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou must needs have a finger in the pie, I
warrant thee!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought, as there were so many of us,
I might as well see what turned up. Well, first we
cut off all their retreats, by girdling them in all
round, blocking up the roads, and breaking down the
bridges. Then, we opened a brisk fire on the
Bavarians who were posted on the upper bridge of
the Inn, and drove them from their guns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Then we rushed on, waving our hats, and
shouting, 'Long live the Emperor!' striking down
some of the enemy with the butt-ends of muskets,
throwing others over the bridge into the water, and
following the rest into the city like a swarm of bees.
We soon made them feel we could <em>sting</em>, too. You
never heard such a cracking of rifles in your life.
Five thousand shooting-matches at once?&mdash;Pshaw,
nothing to come near it. Then such a smoke!
Then such a noise! Every one for himself and all
the world else&mdash;hallooing, shouting, capering, as if
they had no end to their strength, and sounding the
pig-call in derision."</p>

<p>"I'll warrant them!"</p>

<p>"General Kinkel and his men were garrisoning the
town; but what could they do, you know, mother?
They knew the ways of the city, however&mdash;the
streets, passages, gates, and so forth&mdash;better than we,
so they were soon inside the houses, peppering down
upon the Tyrolese from the windows. Well, now
you'd surely think, that as we had the advantage of
them in the open ground, the Bavarians would now
have the advantage of us from the houses. Not so,
mother. How it was, I know not, but they could not
keep their own: our sharpshooters picked off every
man-jack that showed but the tip of his nose at the
windows; so at length they threw down their arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They <em>did</em>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"And cried for mercy!&mdash;Didn't we make an
uproar then! However, there was still a good bit
of fighting; here and there were strong posts they
wouldn't give up, and stout hearts that wouldn't
give in. At the barracks, I believe every man was
shot down. At last, they&mdash;the Tyrolese, I should
say&mdash;got to the house of the Bavarian Commander-in-Chief&mdash;Kinkel,
that is,&mdash;and were calling to him
to surrender, when up comes Colonel Dittfurt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who's he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, you ought to know by this time.
He it was, you know, that was the principal cause of
the Tyrol being separated from Austria, and that
lately said, 'With two regiments of cavalry added to
his infantry, he would cut every one of us ragamuffins
down.'"</p>

<p>"Ah, no good ever comes of brag."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know about that," said Franz,
running his fingers through his rough hair; "but
no good came of it to him this time, at any rate.
He had already got two bullets in his body, they say;
but as soon as his house was attacked, he rushed
forth, waving his sword over his head. A third ball
then struck him near the heart; blood came out of
his mouth, and down he came upon his knees.
Some of our men hastened up to take him prisoner;
he turns about his head, and faintly calls to his men,
'You dogs, don't be cowards,' or something to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
purpose; and evidently did not even then give in.
Whizz! comes another bullet, which hits him in the
head, and lays him along the ground."</p>

<p>"Well, Franz, he died like a soldier&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother, he isn't dead yet&mdash;Don't you hurry
me&mdash;We then captured him and carried him off to
the guard-house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>You?</em>"</p>

<p>"Not exactly I, but our people. And there, as
he lay, ready to die from loss of blood, says he to
one of our fellows&mdash;Rudolf, in fact,&mdash;'Who is your
leader, young man?'&mdash;'We've none in particular,'
says Rudolf,&mdash;which was true enough, only he
needed not to have exposed us so, just then, for no
good, to a man of the Colonel's quality, who, of
course, thought it very despicable of us. If I'd been
Rudolf, I'd have clapped a dozen names together,
mother, and said 'that's our commander.'"</p>

<p>"Then thou wouldst have been a fool, Franz,&mdash;and
thou art little better. Well, is that all?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;'We've no chief in particular,' says Rudolf&mdash;the
ninny!&mdash;'We all,' says he, 'fight for
God,' says he, 'and for our Emperor, and our fatherland,'
says he. 'One for all, and all for one,' says he."</p>

<p>"Ah, as long as folks will do that last," said the
old woman, sighing, "they're sure to win the day.
But their evil tempers, and evil passions, and piques,
and private interests, tugging at their hearts like so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
many evil spirits, part them asunder; and then the
Evil One laughs!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Franz, "all that's beyond me; and
you can't expect a young fellow just come from such
a stirring scene, to be much in the humour for
preaching: but, however, you haven't heard all yet.
Colonel Dittfurt could not make this out&mdash;(no
wonder!)&mdash;it would have made him think very small
of us, if he had. 'Well,' says he, 'I can't believe
that, young man; for I've <em>seen</em> your Commander-in-Chief,'
says he, 'frequently rallying you to-day,'
says he, 'and rushing past me on a milk-white horse,'
says he. Well; when that got about, somebody
wiser than the rest said dying men could often see
further than others into the spirit-world; and that,
'twas very likely, one of the saints, of a martial turn,
had really headed us, though invisibly; and that
therefore it was most agreeable to reason to suppose
it was St. James."</p>

<p>"St. James? why St. James?" said the old
woman slowly. "Was he a fighting man?"</p>

<p>"There you pose me," replied Franz; "but, you
see, he's the patron saint of the city!"</p>

<p>"Ah, that explains!" said his mother. "And did
the Colonel die upon that?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, he's lingering now, but quite given over;
and has a priest with him. Father Donay&mdash;you
know him, mother?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"You know <em>of</em> him then, and that's much the
same&mdash;almost as good."</p>

<p>"Or almost as bad, Franz. I don't know any
good of him."</p>

<p>"Why, now, didn't he get me out of a scrape,
when I'd like to have been shot?"</p>

<p>"By telling a lie, Franz."</p>

<p>"Fiddlestick, mother! 'A charitable fraud,' he
called it, mother."</p>

<p>"Well, Franz, he'll take his payment out of you,
some day or other, 'tis my opinion, if he finds you
can be of any use to him."</p>

<p>"If I can be of any use to him, certainly I will,
out of gratitude, mother. One good turn, you know,
deserves another."</p>

<p>"And one bad turn&mdash;I mean one bad or deceitful
or treacherous action to screen a companion is often
followed, in due course, by that companion being
asked, nay, commanded, to do some dirty trick in
return."</p>

<p>"Well, mother, you will have your say. But I
was going to tell you, that Martin Teimer joined us
just as Dittfurt fell, and helped us well; and as soon
as it was known that the Commander-in-Chief was
captured and mortally wounded, the Bavarians lost
all heart, and laid down their arms to a man. So,
then we had jolly work!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, don't tell me all about the slaying and
slaughtering!"</p>

<p>"Why, there was <em>none</em>, mother! A Tyrolese kill
a captured foe in cold blood?&mdash;Oh, fie!"</p>

<p>"All about the sacking and pillaging, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, a few of the Jews' houses were attacked;
but to no good; for Father Joachim and the Sandwirth
made our fellows refund everything they had
thought lawful spoil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, it was no joking matter. I think a
Christian might fleece a Jew, without much harm
done. However, others thought differently; and
'tis a certain fact, mother, that one of our fellows,
who had carried off the heavy iron door of a Jew's
strong room before the stir was made by the Sandwirth,
and got clear of the city with it, walked fourteen
hours, that is to say all last night, with that
great heavy iron door on his back, thinking it mighty
clever to get it safe to his cottage."</p>

<p>"What did he mean to do with it?"</p>

<p>"I doubt if he knows, any more than I do.
However, he had been at home an hour or so, and
was telling his wife, who had just been confined, all
about the day's work, with great glee; when&mdash;in
walks the priest. 'What have we here?' says he,
stumbling over the iron door. As soon as ever he
heard how it was come by,&mdash;'Now you go,' says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
priest, 'and carry that door all the way back again.
The commandment says, Thou shalt not steal, without
saying of Jew or Christian; take it back this
minute! It will be a suitable penance; for believe
me, my son, thou hast sinned.' So the poor fellow
heaved it up again, though his back was half broken
already, and trudged away with it, as meek as a lamb;
and when I met him, he was half way to Innsbruck."</p>

<p>"He'll come back with a lightened heart, as well
as lightened shoulders, Franz."</p>

<p>"What know I?" said Franz with indifference.
"After such a hard day's fight as we'd had, I think
we might have had a few pickings. And there were
the simple fellows that had never been in Innsbruck
before, rambling in great parties about the streets,
staring and making their remarks about everything,
and crowding into the cathedral to see the emperor
Max's great monument with those grim iron giants
of dead kings to guard it&mdash;and women and girls
pouring out of the old part of the city, to give us
cakes, and cream-cheeses, and wine, and bread, and
beer&mdash;whatever came first to hand, and laughing and
chattering, and praising us, and saying what a
glorious day!"</p>

<p>"Well, it <em>was</em> a glorious day," said the old woman
reflectively.</p>

<p>"So much, done so quickly!" continued Franz.
"Why, mother! the town was ours by eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
o'clock! How surprised some of the men looked
when they heard the clocks strike!&mdash;They had just
then discovered and laid hold of the Imperial Eagle
on the emperor Max's tomb; and, after tying a lot
of red ribands round its neck and legs, they set it
up aloft and carried it through the streets, shouting
and singing, and saying they'd always be true to it.
Meantime, another lot of fellows had come upon the
pictures of our Franzel<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and Hannes,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> and had
hauled them down and were carrying <em>them</em> about,
too, triumphing and making merry and crying they
would shed their last drop of blood for them!"</p>

<p>"What a pity our Franzel was not there to hear
it," said his mother; "it would have warmed his
dear heart."</p>

<p>"They set the pictures against a sort of arch,"
pursued Franz, "and put lighted candles round
them, and bawled 'Long live the Emperor!' There
was a good deal of foolery in it."</p>

<p>"They were in mad spirits at their success, and
no wonder," said the old woman; "especially if
they had made free with the contents of the brandy-shops."</p>

<p>"No, mother, no.&mdash;Not one of them was drunk,
nor the least inclined that way&mdash;I saw many of them
drinking water, as if they could have drunk the sea
dry; and others smacking their lips after a bottle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
beer, or munching a rye-cake as if it were a feast
for the emperor. Towards nightfall, they were completely
tired out; numbers lay down to rest, in the
streets, and were asleep in a moment; some on
straw, some without it; while others prepared to
camp out all night in the orchards. I thought I
might as well be walking homewards as that, and so I
started off: no doubt the Bavarians will be down upon
them with reinforcements to-day or to-morrow."</p>

<p>"And then they'll lose all they've won," said the
old woman. "Well, that will be a pity."</p>

<p>She sat musing upon it, while Franz went in-doors,
and presently came out again, devouring a
great rye-cake, and a lump of cheese. He sat down
on an inverted milk-pail, and, while he continued
eating, he watched a girl who was coming up from
the valley with a long hazel wand in her hand.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a short, scanty petticoat of
bright grass-green, with a black bodice that was
laced in front over a chemise with short full sleeves
of snowy whiteness. On her head she wore a small
black, sugar-loaf hat, with a gay riband tied round it.
Her appearance, at a distance, was excessively picturesque;
but when she drew near, she proved to be
very plain, with thick ankles, a thick waist, and large,
red, coarse hands.</p>

<p>"Here comes Lenora," said Franz, at length;
speaking with his mouth full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Soh!" said the old woman, with a kind of
snort, "she is vouchsafing to return home at last, is
she? She might have come to look after me in the
course of this long morning, I should think. But
girls now are not what girls used to be."</p>

<p>It would appear from this speech, that Lenora
ought to have joined the couple who were seated
outside the cottage, with the penitent air of one
who had neglected her duty; but, on the contrary,
she took up quite another tone.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Franz!" shouted she, in a voice that
would have filled St. Paul's, "you're come back
again at last, are you, sir, after leaving me these
twenty-four hours to do your work!&mdash;you might, at
any rate, have had the civility to tell me you were
going; but no, not you!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" said Franz, doggedly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" repeated Lenora, still
chafing; "why, have not I, in addition to my own
work, had to do every bit of man's work that has
been done about the place? Who, but for me,
would have watered the horse, turned out the cows,
sheep, and goats after milking, and a hundred things
besides? As I was driving our sheep to pasture,
Gaspard looked over the hedge, and 'Do the same
for me, my good girl, will you?' says he, 'for I'm
off with my rifle.' So there was I with two flocks
of sheep on my hands, besides the cows and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
goats; and, not knowing exactly how many sheep
Gaspard had, I counted them twice very carefully,
and, the second time, I missed one. So I wasn't
by any means sure whether I had counted them
wrong the first time, or whether one had strayed;
but somehow I thought one had strayed, because I
fancied I remembered that the number was an odd
number, and now it was even; and also that I had
remarked a weak-eyed, rather ill-looking ewe, that
had something particular in its bleat. Well, I could
see nothing of this ewe, so I made sure it had
strayed; and, as it belonged to a neighbour, I was
even more sorry for it than if it had been my own.
So I sought it here, and I sought it there; first in
all the likely, and next in all the unlikely places;
and, meanwhile, the sun was scorching hot, as if it
had been August. At last I got to the pass where
one of your cows pitched over last spring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was a good way off," muttered Franz.</p>

<p>"Truly it was," said the girl, with self-pity;
"however, there I trudged; and just as I had got
to the brink of the ravine I heard that queer-sounding
bleat. I looked down, and there was the
ewe, who had toppled over and fallen into the upper
part of a thorn-bush, from which she could not get
out. So I had to scramble down, get hold of her,
and lay her across my shoulders, climb up the bank
again, and carry her all the way back. Such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
weight she was! All this trouble you might have
saved me."</p>

<p>&mdash;"Lenora!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"We've taken Innsbruck!"</p>

<p>"No!"&mdash;</p>

<p>He had to tell his story all over again.</p>

INNSBRUCK.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">P</span>ICTURE to yourself an old cathedral-town in
the midst of a valley about three miles across,
hemmed in by magnificent mountains six to eight
thousand feet high, from whose summits the wolves
are said to look down into the very streets. The
city stands on a deep, impetuous river&mdash;the Inn;
and hence its name, Innsbruck, or Inn's Bridge.</p>

<p>This city is but of moderate extent; but few
towns of its size contain, in the modern part, better
and handsomer buildings; and its suburbs are remarkable
for cleanliness and elegance. The old
part of the city is picturesque enough: there you
may see tumble-down old houses nodding with age,
having rickety outside staircases leading to old,
rickety wooden galleries or balconies; crumbling
walls kept together with old timbers nailed outside
in various quaint fashions; upper floors overhanging
lower ones, and supported with rows of carved
brackets, or by poles imbedded in the pavement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
below; antique gables, fantastically decorated, with
grotesque heads on the spouts between them.</p>

<p>Many of these antiquated streets have low arcades,
which afford capital shelter to women who
sell fruit, cakes, cheeses, sausages, and get through
a great deal of gossip. The shops are homely and
primitive, with very few outward allurements to
attract customers. They are mostly in the
"general" line, and deal indifferently in groceries,
medicines, straw-hats, coarse thread, ready-made
garments, and old rags and bottles.</p>

<p>In these dwellings a great many generations have
been born and brought up; have eaten, drunk, slept,
talked over the news of the day, thought the world
was coming to an end because of some matter which
the next generation thought infinitely unimportant
and succeeding generations have forgotten altogether;&mdash;marketed,
made good bargains, bad bargains,
grown poor, grown well-to-do in the world,
fallen sick, got well again, gone to weddings and
funerals, gone to church at six o'clock in the
morning, made friends, made enemies, been disappointed
in friends, lived down the slanders of
enemies, found life a very hard battle, sometimes
won it, sometimes not, resolved never to be deceived
again, or to do a wrong or foolish thing any more,
found that cheerfulness is a salve for many reverses,
and contentment a great set-off against straitened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
means, remembered how much better everything
was in their young days, grown old before they were
aware of it, ailed a little, dropped aside and out of
sight, except of the priest, doctor, and one or two
old friends,&mdash;in short, been, and done, and felt, and
enjoyed, and suffered, just like the rest of the
world.</p>

<p>If the spiders could talk, doubtless they would be
able to tell you many interesting stories of these
people; for the human heart is the same all over
the world, but its experiences are infinitely various;
as various as human faces.</p>

<p>At the court-end are the triumphal arch built by
Maria Theresa; the Neustadt, a fine wide street,
with a fountain in the centre; the town-hall, the
theatre, and the spacious palace assigned as the
residence of the governor of the Tyrol. These
buildings are surrounded by public pleasure-grounds,
well planted, and extending to the fine chestnut
avenue on the banks of the river, which is a favourite
resort of the townspeople in fine weather.</p>

<p>The market-place, too, is very gay. There you
may see old women in red jackets and witch-like
hats, squatted behind a small spread of eggs, butter,
salad, onions, lettuces, &amp;c.: young girls, in tight-laced
purple bodices, and short, full, snow-white
sleeves, arranging baskets of peaches and apricots;
children, with brown, ruddy faces, offering for sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
large nosegays of rhododendrons, harebells, cowslips,
anemones, lilies-of-the-valley, honeysuckles; or little
heaps of small bright scarlet strawberries; men,
unloading ox-wains of fire-wood, or shouldering
little sacks of corn, steering their way amid piles of
coarse earthenware, spread on the ground.</p>

<p>But the chief glory of Innsbruck is its churches;
especially its <i>Hofkirch</i>, or Cathedral, the wonders of
which are hardly to be sufficiently explored in a
single day. Here is the famous tomb of the Emperor
Maximilian the First, who died in 1519: and who
is represented at the top of the tomb, kneeling, with
his face towards the altar. Round the sides of this
tomb, which is about six feet high and thirteen feet
in length, are a wonderful series of what have been
poetically called "pictures in marble"&mdash;exquisite
carvings, that is, in Carrara marble, of various events
in the Emperor's life. Guarding this tomb, as it
were, in stern and solemn array, are eight-and-twenty
colossal bronze statues of famous princes,
warriors, and chieftains; including our own king
Arthur. "When the gloom of evening," says Inglis,
"begins to fall among these dark-visaged and gigantic
kings and knights, the effect is almost terrific."</p>

<p>Round and about this wondrous tomb, with
looks of simple surprise and admiration, strayed
many of Hofer's rustic companions on the famous
11th of April, as well as Hofer himself. When his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
heart heaved within him as he gazed on the effigies
of those mighty men of renown, he little thought
that, in times to come, times not far distant,
travellers from distant lands would flock to that
old church, to see&mdash;not the eight-and-twenty
champions, nor the kneeling emperor,&mdash;but, the
presentment of a humble, heroic Tyrolese peasant,
with face upturned to Heaven, one hand grasping
the national banner, the other holding the barrel of
the rifle slung from his shoulder. "We know what
we are," said poor Ophelia, "but we know not what
we shall be."</p>

<p>Even in the gladness of that day, there was a
heaviness at his heart. His companions were shouting,
singing, and waving their feathered hats round
the Imperial eagle as they carried it through the
streets&mdash;<em>he</em> was standing, lonely, in the church;
kneeling; praying.</p>

<p>It was not a long prayer, but a hearty one; a
prayer such as God loves. "O God! I thank Thee
for this day's success, but I know not whither it will
lead. Oh, guide us, guide us, for Thy goodness'
sake, O Lord, in Christ Jesus!"</p>

<p>It <em>was</em> a success. Eight thousand French and
Bavarians had laid down their arms, and surrendered
at discretion, with their eagles, colours, and munitions
of war; while only twenty-six Tyrolese had
been killed, and forty-two wounded. Hofer personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
knew some of the twenty-six, however, and
felt a manly sorrow for them: <em>only</em> twenty-six
dead men may leave behind them a good many sad
hearts.</p>

<p>The enemy's cavalry took to flight, but were
stopped and made prisoners by Speckbacher, in the
meadows near Halle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our friends in the green jackets, who
were perambulating the streets of Innsbruck, assembled
themselves together in front of the Palace,
and amused themselves by shooting down the
Bavarian lion from over the entrance; after which
their patriotic souls were vexed by seeing the hated
blue and white stripes of Bavaria decorating sundry
buildings; whence a great cry for paint-pots arose,
and they ransacked the oilmen's shops for all their
stores of black and yellow paint, and with hog's hair
brushes and ladders, set themselves diligently to
work to efface the enemy's emblems and substitute
the Imperial colours.</p>

<p>Some others of these merry hearts thought nothing
wanting but a little good music; and, as all the
instruments they were able to muster among themselves,
proved to be two fifes, two fiddles, two rusty
iron pot-lids, and a few Jews'-harps, they did not
scruple to impress the Bavarian band into their
service, and make them patrol the city playing
triumphal tunes in honour of their own defeat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>There were likewise certain native ballad-singers
of the itinerant order, who turned a good many
pence, that is to say kreutzers, this day, by vocalizing
on their own account, at tavern-doors and in
public places, to the great delight of the Tyrolese,
who sat on benches and on door-steps, listening to
them while they quaffed hot coffee in thick ale-glasses,
or tasted for the first, and perhaps last time
in their lives, iced rum and water.</p>

<p>Others of them were not too tired to get up a
game of bowls in the market-place, which excited
immense merriment among themselves, and crowds
of townspeople at the windows, with whom they
talked as comfortably as if they had known them a
hundred years. Just as they had had enough of it,
Punch very opportunely made his appearance, and
kept them amused till it was dark. Then they lay
down on the ground, in and about the town, and
slept soundly all night.</p>

<p>Hofer thought he should like to see a play. So,
to the theatre he went, where, on asking what there
was to pay, the money-taker with a bow replied,
"Nothing." So he walked into the boxes, and
picked out the very best place; where his remarkable
dress and person drew on him the attention of
every one in the house.</p>

<p>But if they thought a good deal of him, he was
very little aware of it; for there were a great many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
things to employ his attention. In the first place,
there seemed to him a great waste of wax lights;
half the number would have been quite sufficient.
In the second place, the ladies' dresses appeared to
him a great deal too low, too short, and too scanty:
he hardly liked to look at them, and was very glad
to see no other Tyrolese in the house. In the third
place, the orchestral music, when it struck up, quite
took him by surprise: he had a sensitive though
untutored ear, and a tender heart; its dying falls
and gradual swells, its minors, its concords, its
plaintive and its impassioned strains, nearly overpowered
him.</p>

<p>Luckily, the curtain drew up, the music ceased,
and the play began. Hofer could not understand
much of it. But, on the whole, he thought it
funny, and concluded it clever,&mdash;and did not know
whether he should ever care to go to a play
again.</p>

<p>"They seem to make very light of swearing,"
thought he; "I have frequently heard them take
God's holy name in vain. Some of their dresses,
also, are immodest, and as for their music, it makes
a man's heart like cream-cheese. The story, too,
by what I can make out of their acting, is of two
young persons who deceive their parents very much,
tell many lies, and think only of their own selfish
wishes; yet they are rewarded and applauded at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
last, while the old people are laughed at for having
been ill-used. So that, altogether, I am glad to
see none of our dear Tyrolese here to-night, for it
would soften and demoralize them."</p>

<p>With these reflections, the thoughtful father of a
family quitted his seat at the end of the performance,
and stood about in the lobby, looking rather
bewildered and uncertain which was his way out;
while many smart townspeople of the upper classes
looked at him with curiosity and interest as they
passed. Our English readers may wonder that,
after such a day of stern realities, people could be
found with minds sufficiently disengaged to enter
a theatre;&mdash;but our continental neighbours are as
fond of their play as&mdash;what shall we say?&mdash;an
Englishman of his dinner. Both parties <em>can</em> go
without it, if there be some stringent necessity;
but never from inclination.</p>

<p>Hofer was not quite so new to Innsbruck as the
generality of his comrades. He had never passed
a night there, indeed, but he had occasionally,
though rarely, gone thither on business connected
with his trade, which had brought him into some
slight acquaintance with a brother innkeeper, by
name Michael Stumff, whose sign was the "Goldener
Adler."</p>

<p>As Hofer stood in the lobby of the theatre,
spoken to by none, though gazed on by many, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
pretty looking young woman, with a respectably
dressed young man for her companion, came up
and accosted him.</p>

<p>"So you have come to see our theatre, Sandwirth,"
said she, frankly. "Do you not know who
I am? I am Alouise Stumff, Michael Stumff's
daughter."</p>

<p>"Ah, Alouise! I did not know you at first," said
Hofer, looking pleased, and holding out his brown
hand to her rather red one.</p>

<p>"Are you going to spend the night in Innsbruck,
Sandwirth?" said Alouise, who addressed him with
perfect ease and a little affability, as if it were kind
of her to take notice of him. "My father will be
very glad if you will take a bed at his house."</p>

<p>"That will suit me well," said Hofer, in his plain,
homely manner. "I was considering where to
bestow myself. So I will go home with you, if it
please you, Alouise."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Alouise briskly. "This
young man is a neighbour's son, Sandwirth, Leopold
Mayer; we are very old friends."</p>

<p>When they reached the "Goldener Adler,"
Michael Stumff was surprised and rather pleased to
see his old acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Why, Sandwirth, this is an unexpected honour,"
said he. "You are kindly welcome."</p>

<p>"Praised be Jesus Christ," said Hofer, reverently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
using the greeting customary among the Tyrolese;
but, perceiving that the other did not respond "for
ever and ever, Amen," he after a pause, continued:</p>

<p>"Unexpected enough, it may be, Michael Stumff;
but an honour I cannot think it. However, I am
glad you say I am kindly welcome."</p>

<p>"How can you be otherwise," said Stumff,
"when you have performed such a glorious work
this day, leading the men of Passeyr on to victory?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, oh no," said Hofer, "there was no
leading in the case. We were all just as equal as
so many sheep. God was our shepherd."</p>

<p>"The Bavarians were more like sheep, to my
thinking," said Stumff, with a jovial laugh. "They
<em>did</em> run, to be sure!"</p>

<p>"Better for both parties that they should save
us the necessity of shooting them," said Hofer.
"However, I don't expect we've seen the last of
them."</p>

<p>"I was just going to ask you, Sandwirth&mdash;(let us
have supper, Alouise)&mdash;Surely you don't think them
put down with one day's drubbing?"</p>

<p>"Surely, no," said Hofer; "I look to see them
again in a day or two, or at furthest, by the end of
the week, and then with God's blessing, we'll drub
them again."</p>

<p>"And shall you all keep together here, in Innsbruck,
till then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>"We cannot. This is a busy time with us in
the field; we must plough and sow."</p>

<p>"But, directly your backs are turned the enemy
will come back! Besides, what are you going to do
with all your prisoners?"</p>

<p>"I'll think of it on my pillow," said Hofer.
"Now, supper."</p>

<p>For he was true to the saying his wife quoted of
him. "One thing at a time will last the longer."
And besides, the Wirth of the "Goldener Adler"
was not Speckbacher; and he had no mind to tell
him all his plans before he had digested them.</p>

<p>"Well, and so you've been to the play," said
Stumff, slicing away at a ham, and hospitably
loading Hofer's plate. "How did you like it?"</p>

<p>"Some things I liked; others I liked not."</p>

<p>"What did you like?"</p>

<p>"The house was beautiful as a dream&mdash;but where
was the good of it? Directly the play is over all
melts away, like a day's frost!"</p>

<p>"<em>All?</em> what?"</p>

<p>"Why,&mdash;the impression."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, but we can renew the impression
every night; and we do not want it all day."</p>

<p>"Truly no," said Hofer. "And I doubt its
being good to renew it every night."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Too softening and enervating."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Stumff laughed a jolly laugh.</p>

<p>"Did not you like the music, Sandwirth?" cried
Alouise.</p>

<p>"Too much," said he, sighing. "It made my
heart ready to burst."</p>

<p>"The dancing, then?"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>Alouise smiled. "Oh!" said she, "you are
getting too grave and steady, at your time of life;
but you would have liked it when you were
young."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should&mdash;perhaps I should not; but
that would not have made it good or bad."</p>

<p>"Then, the ladies' dresses, Sandwirth?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" with a grimace.</p>

<p>Stumff laughed. "What of them?" said he.</p>

<p>"Too little dress&mdash;too much exposure."</p>

<p>"Why, there's no satisfying you, Sandwirth."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said he, smiling. "One play has
satisfied me&mdash;I don't want to go again."</p>

<p>"Your daughter would like it," said Alouise,
decisively.</p>

<p>"I should not wish to give her a taste for such
things," said Hofer. "She is perfectly content as
she is."</p>

<p>"And that's more than I can say of <em>my</em> girl
sometimes," said Stumff, with a smile and a shrug,
as Alouise left them for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder," said Hofer, after a short silence,
"that you let <em>her</em> go to the theatre."</p>

<p>"I should be considered quite a bear, not only
by her, but by all Innsbruck, if I denied her," said
Stumff. "No, no, Sandwirth,&mdash;we town-folks are
not quite the same with you village-folks,&mdash;it does
our girls no hurt, I believe&mdash;or, if it does, we can't
help it. And now, as you seem tired, I'll show
you your bed. What! you must take your dearly-beloved
rifle along with you, hey? Ha, ha!"</p>

STILL SUCCESSFUL.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HEN Michael Stumff came down to breakfast
the next morning, he looked round for
his guest in vain.</p>

<p>"Where's the Sandwirth?" said he to Alouise.</p>

<p>"Half way to the Brenner, I suppose," said
Alouise. "Why, father, you must have slept
heavily, if you did not hear the uproar this morning!
The alarm-bells began to ring before it was light,
and a dozen country fellows came running down the
street, bawling 'Sandwirth! Sandwirth!' Open
flew the Sandwirth's window; he gives a <i>jödel</i><a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
that might be heard a mile off, which makes them
stop short. 'Here I am, my boys,' cries he, 'what's
the matter?' The next moment they were all
under his window. 'Speckbacher took Halle yesterday!'
cries one. 'Hurra!' cries Hofer. 'But
the French and Bavarians are coming down upon
us from the Brenner,' cries another. 'Aha! then
we'll go to meet them,' cries Hofer; 'I'll be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
you this minute.' And his door flew open. I just
popped my head out of mine, and said, 'Sandwirth,
I'll be down directly, if you will wait for some
breakfast.' 'No time, thank you,' replied he, running
along the gallery. 'Just one cup of coffee!'
cried I. 'No, dear; we are going to breakfast on
gunpowder,' says he, laughing: and so off. Dear
me, it quite set my heart a-beating; it was all in
such a moment. Who knows? Perhaps the Bavarians
may be masters of Innsbruck again, before
nightfall, father?"</p>

<p>"There's no knowing, child."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I could have done less than
ask the Sandwirth home, father, when I saw him
last night, standing about, in the lobby, looking quite
puzzled."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, child. The poor, simple fellow"&mdash;said
Stumff, with an air of complacent superiority&mdash;"would
have come to mischief of one sort or
another, for he knows as little as a child. A brave,
honest heart, and a good marksman, Alouise; and
when you've said that, you've said all. Give me
my breakfast quick, child, that I may go out and
look about me a little."</p>

<p>Alouise poured out his coffee, and gave him a
slice of bread, and then hurried to the house door,
calling eagerly to one or two persons who were hurrying
along, to ask them what was going forward. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
only replied, "Atzwanger is turning out the armed
burghers," and ran off; and her father, with his
mouth full, soon followed, bidding her take good
care of the house. So there was she, alone in the
midst of bustle, feeling solitude doubly lonely, till at
length she called to a little boy who was cleaning
knives, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dolf, run down to the gates, and bring me word
what is going on."</p>

<p>When he was gone, she thought he would perhaps
not return; and felt more solitary than ever, till the
young man who had escorted her to the theatre
dropped in.</p>

<p>"We're in a fine mess," said he. "Here are
the Bavarians coming back."</p>

<p>"Aye&mdash;what shall we do? Perhaps they will get
possession of Innsbruck again."</p>

<p>"Very likely. For my part, I hope they will."</p>

<p>"Oh, Leopold! How can you be so unpatriotic?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, Alouise, Buonaparte is sure to
get the better of us in the end, so he may as well
beat us at once and have done with it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he won't beat us in the end."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he will."</p>

<p>"That's no argument. Why don't you go and
help fight?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I'm not that way inclined. I told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Atzwanger I'd sprained my trigger-finger. What's
all that hammering about, up stairs? Are you
putting up defences?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! A poor lame man lodges in our attic,
who is amusing himself by making a barrel-organ,
with a curious set of dancing automatons at the top.
His whole heart is in it. He thinks the Tyrolese
war nothing in comparison. Indeed, I doubt if he
knows there is one."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take him up his breakfast, and hear
what he has to say about it; and you can hear what
I say and what he says, if you prick up your ears."</p>

<p>Leopold went to the foot of a dark, steep back-stair,
up which Alouise tripped, with a coffee-pot
and some bread; and after she had tapped at the
door he heard the following dialogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come in!"</p>

<p>"I've brought you some breakfast, Martin."</p>

<p>"Thank you; though I am almost too busy to
eat it."</p>

<p>"How are you getting on?"</p>

<p>"Take care! don't tread on that barrel!"</p>

<p>"I don't see one."</p>

<p>"Not a beer-barrel, but an organ-barrel."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see; well, do you know what a bustle we
were in, yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Chimney-sweeps?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Chimney-sweeps! no! Why, the Tyrolese took
Innsbruck, and drove out the Bavarians!"</p>

<p>"You don't say so! Soho! hum! A pretty
piece of work. I'll hear all about it presently, or the
glue will get cold. I'm afraid, you see, Alouise,
that this glue is not strong enough; which is the
reason why the woodwork will not stick. Soho!&mdash;poor
Tyrolese!"</p>

<p>"Poor Bavarians, you mean! Why, the Tyrolese
won the day!"</p>

<p>"Oh, did they so really? Well, now,&mdash;humph!&mdash;poor
fellows!"</p>

<p>"And we had one of them to sleep here, last
night."</p>

<p>"Really, really! By the bye, are you anything
of a mechanician?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>"Then it's no use asking you the thing I want
to know. Hum!&mdash;poor Innsbruckers&mdash;poor Tyrolese,
I mean."</p>

<p>"But, Martin, we Innsbruckers <em>are</em> Tyrolese."</p>

<p>"To be sure, to be sure&mdash;who doesn't know
that? This tiresome glue! That was just what I
was saying."</p>

<p>"That? What?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;now you puzzle me&mdash;I think this will
stick, at last."</p>

<p>"Well, I see you don't take any interest in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
matter, so I won't waste your time. Perhaps the
Bavarians will have recovered possession of the town
before bedtime."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, perhaps so&mdash;nothing more likely."</p>

<p>She ran down stairs, laughing. "Just the old
story," said she to Leopold; "every man thinking
his own affairs of more importance than those of all
the world besides. How now, Dolf?" to the boy,
who ran in glowing and panting.</p>

<p>"There's fine work, mistress. They're barricading
the gates with casks and wagons, and closing all
the houses. May I go back?"</p>

<p>"No, no, you must not leave me."</p>

<p>"I'll bring you word every ten minutes how
things are going on.&mdash;It's so jolly!"</p>

<p>"Well, Dolf, if you will promise me very faithfully
indeed to do that, you may go; and I'll give you a
cake at supper-time besides. But mind you keep
an eye, if you can, on my father."</p>

<p>Away scampered the boy; and Leopold prepared
to go too.</p>

<p>"Don't you go," said Alouise. "I shall be
afraid."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," said he, stretching himself and
yawning. She gave him an old newspaper, which
he began to pore over; but on returning to the
kitchen after a short absence, she found him gone.</p>

<p>"That's just the way," said she to herself, pouting;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
"much he cares for my safety, in spite of the
pretty things he said to me last night. I suppose
Nannette will be off next, if I do not go to look
after her."</p>

<p>Nannette was stretching her head out of one of
the upper windows, so intent on catching all she
could of the distant uproar, that she was not aware
of her mistress's presence till Alouise gave a smart
pluck at her dress. However, Alouise had no sooner
set her to scour the bedrooms than she herself went
up to the very top of the house, which had, like
many of the dwellings in the Tyrol, a sort of open
story or penthouse raised over the flat roof, from
whence she could descry a little, but not much, of
the stir near the gates.</p>

<p>Dolf returned once or twice to report various
successes, including the capture of General Wrede,
and, towards nine o'clock (for they are early people),
numbers of men running through the streets, waving
their hats and shouting, proclaimed the day to be
won by the Tyrolese.</p>

<p>In consequence of a letter which Martin Teimer
had compelled General Kinkel to write to the
Bavarian commander, General Wrede himself,
accompanied by a French officer, had ridden to the
gates, with so strong a guard, that the Tyrolese, considering
them aggressors, drove them back with
great loss, and took the General and his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
prisoners. The discomfited fugitives carried back to
their lines such a formidable account of the strength
and fury of the Tyrolese, that the French and Bavarians
were thrown into the greatest consternation,
especially the latter, who had lost their principal
officer.</p>

<p>Martin Teimer, accompanied by Baron Taxis and
Atzwanger, the leader of the armed burghers, and
also by several Tyrolese leaders, repaired to the
French lines, where they were courteously received
by Colonel Bisson, who protested he intended no
injury to the town, and merely wished to carry his
troops unmolested to Augsburg. He made no stipulation
for the Bavarians. Teimer, inspirited by his
capture of Wrede, would hear of nothing short of
the surrender of the whole army, to which Bisson
a little impatiently replied that he would rather
sacrifice every man under his command.</p>

<p>Teimer, without deigning a reply, returned to
the Tyrolese, who immediately opened a deadly fire
on the enemy. Their shouts and impetuosity so
petrified the French grenadiers that for a while they
stood motionless without returning a shot. The
French officers conjured Bisson to surrender on
honourable terms to Teimer, whom they recalled for
the purpose, and Bisson at length most reluctantly
countersigned the following articles, which the
reader may decide whether honourable or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the name of Francis the First, Emperor of
Austria, the French and Bavarian troops at Steinach
and Wiltau, agree to the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First. That they shall immediately lay down
their arms.</p>

<p>"Second. That the whole body of the eighth
division shall surrender to the Austrian troops at
Schwatz.</p>

<p>"Third. That any Tyrolese who have been made

<p>The prisoners thus made, were marched to
Schwatz, and thence to Salzburg, under the escort
of <em>women</em>; as men could not be spared for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
occasion. The success of this day (achieved before
nine o'clock in the morning) was undoubtedly
mainly owing to Martin Teimer; as General
Chastelar, though pushing on from Sterzing, did
not arrive in time to be of any use. Buonaparte,
however, provoked at the issue of the day, and not
stooping to such ignoble prey, at present, as Tyrolean
innkeepers and tobacconists, issued an act of outlawry
against "the person named Chastelar, styling
himself a general in the Austrian service," charging
him (without the least ground) with the massacre of
prisoners; and sentencing him, if caught, to be
tried by martial law, and, if found guilty, to be shot
in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the worthy general was thinking it no
scorn to entertain Hofer and Martin Teimer at his
table, and talk over the events of the day. The Tyrolese
are temperate and abstemious to a proverb; but
these mountaineers had fought hard and were hungry;
they probably had never heard the Wise King's
injunction, "When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
consider diligently what is before thee; and put a
knife to thy throat if thou be given to appetite;"
and therefore drank the sweet and ate the fat with
relish that was too little disguised to escape the
satirical notice of certain junior officers, by whom
it was afterwards turned against them. After all,
they ate and drank but moderately, and were much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
fuller of their success than their dinner; yet they
spoke but moderately too, and in simple phrase;
and their censors decided them to be phlegmatic.
The good-natured Chastelar pushed the wine towards
them and bade them drink to the Emperor.</p>

HOME.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">A</span>NNA Hofer was kneeling before the crucifix in
the corner of her kitchen, praying as fervently
as if she had been privileged to own a purer faith;
and, with every bead that ran through her fingers,
letting fall a tear far more precious than a pearl of
great price. What opportunity had she had of living
under a better dispensation? Romanism was the
only form of Christianity the Tyrolese were acquainted
with; and while, among their invaders,
infidelity was rampant, the simplicity and fervour of
their piety made them, as far as in them lay, champions
of the Christian faith.</p>

<p>Anna, then, knelt before the crucifix, wrestling in
prayer, with groans and sighings that could not be
uttered. Judge of her revulsion of feeling, when
a beloved voice close to her said, "Anna!"</p>

<p>"Oh, my good man, is't thou?" And she cast
herself into his arms. "What, then! is the war
over, husband?"</p>

<p>"Dearest woman, no! But we have a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
breathing space; for a little while our enemies are
scattered, and the men of Tyrol too. As soon as
they make head again, we shall swarm about them
like bees. Meanwhile, we must plough, and we
must sow."</p>

<p>"I <em>have</em> sown our field, Anderl. It was ploughed
already."</p>

<p>"Dear wife&mdash;" and he kissed her. "How hast
thou sown it?"</p>

<p>"That which was buckwheat, with barley and
rye; and that which was barley and rye, with buckwheat."</p>

<p>"Right. Where's Theresa?"</p>

<p>"Looking after the horse. The children are
keeping the cows, goats, and sheep. Here comes
Theresa."</p>

<p>Theresa flew up to her father, and embraced him;
then overwhelmed him with a thousand questions.</p>

<p>"One at a time will last the longer," said he;
and drawing her to his knee, with his wife close
beside him, he rehearsed to them in detail what has
here been recounted more briefly; interjecting warm
praise of Chastelar, Hormayr, and Martin Teimer.</p>

<p>"See here," continued he, pulling forth a paper,
"what a beautiful letter our dear Emperor has
written us:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My dear and faithful Tyrolese!'&mdash;"</p>

<p>&mdash;"No! does our Franzel really say so?" interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Anna, eagerly leaning over his shoulder, to
satisfy herself. "How beautifully expressed! A
petty commandant, look you, would hardly be so
affable!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"'My dear and faithful Tyrolese! Since the
sacrifices which the unfortunate year 1805 compelled
me to make, when I was obliged to separate from
you, my heart has been constantly with you, my
honest, affectionate children!'"&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>That</em>'s warm from the heart, anyhow!" muttered
Anna.</p>

<p>"'As a last proof of my affection, I stipulated
for the preservation of your Constitution; and it
gave me the greatest pain to see this&mdash;this'"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Institution," suggested Theresa.</p>

<p>"No, nonsense&mdash;'This stipulation disregarded,
which I had made for your advantage; but, alas! at
that time I was unable to assist you, and could only
lament your fate in private.'"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Poor dear man! doubtless it cost him many a
secret tear," interjected Anna.</p>

<p>"'When a new cause again obliged me to draw
my sword, my first thought was to become again
your father. An army was put in motion to effect
your deliverance; but before it could meet our
common enemy, you had by your gallantry struck
a decisive blow, and proved to the whole world, as
well as myself, what you are ready to do to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
again a part of that kingdom under which for centuries
past you have lived contented and happy&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Beautiful, beautiful!" ejaculated Anna. "What
golden words!"</p>

<p>"There's some more, mother," said Theresa.</p>

<p>"'Your efforts have touched my heart&mdash;I know
your courage; I am ready to meet all your wishes,
and to count you amongst the best and most faithful
subjects in the Austrian dominions. It will be my
earnest endeavour to prevent our being again separated:
millions, who were long your brothers, will
be eager to draw their swords in the cause! I trust,
therefore, in you; and you may rely on me. So, by
God's assistance, Austria and the Tyrol will be again
united as they were in former years.</p>

</p>

<p>"Dear, dear, dear, only think of an emperor like
him to write in that way to a poor man like thee,
Anderl," said Anna.</p>

<p>"Not to me in particular," said Hofer; "to all
my weapon-brothers as well."</p>

<p>"At any rate, he could not speak more fair, nor
more handsome&mdash;dear Franzel! Do let me look
close at his letter with my very own eyes. Why,
now, the dear Emperor spells Tyrol with two l's, as
you do, Anderl, sometimes; but he writes a deal
better," nudging him with her elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>"As an emperor is likely to do," said Hofer, his
good white teeth gleaming right merrily through his
black beard. "Why, now, I copied that letter myself,
and it's my own handwriting: so a precious
one you are to have a cut at me!"</p>

<p>"You? Why, you told me it was the Emperor's!"</p>

<p>"Aye, his words, but not his penmanship. Why,
think you there was a man of us all that would
not get a copy of it, if he could?"</p>

<p>"Oh well, I thought his hand wondrous like
thine, man. Don't you believe you took me in!
Why, didn't I find out the two l's?"</p>

<p>"Aye, but you thought them the emperor's!"</p>

<p>"Never mind! the sense is the thing. This
letter deserves to be framed and glazed; aye, framed
in gold: and since we can't afford that, I'll paste it
against the wall."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not a bad notion. Is dinner
ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, father," said Theresa, slipping from his
knee, and hastening to spread the table. "You've
dined with a many strange people, I suppose, since
you went away."</p>

<p>"That have I, girl,&mdash;with General Chastelar and
Baron Hormayr; but great folks eat so fast and talk
so fast, there's no taking one's comfort. They
snatch away your plate before 'tis empty, bob a dish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
under your nose, and whisk it off if you look at it
twice before you help yourself."</p>

<p>"A good way of having a dinner for next day,"
said Anna, laughing.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye; and when I and the men of Passeyr
got to Botzen, where Baron Hormayr and all his
staff came out to receive us with honour, he uncovering
his head and letting his hair blow about in
the wind,&mdash;I warrant you, General Marschall refused
to sit down to table with a humble man like me;
just as if a guest wasn't good enough for him that
was good enough for Hormayr!"</p>

<p>"Well! to think of that!" cried Anna indignantly.
"I hope the Baron told him a piece of his
mind."</p>

<p>"No, no; he had too much temper and sense,"
said Hofer. "He just made a little grimace to me
behind his back, and I took no umbrage; only it
showed the nature of the man."</p>

<p>"What a good thing Baron Hormayr is not of
his sort," said Theresa.</p>

<p>"Oh, the general has his merits, after all," said
Hofer, stroking his beard. "He is a good fighting
man, but his pride is so great, that not even his own
soldiers like him. See, dear women, how evil a
thing pride is."</p>

<p>"And what is being done now, Anderl?"</p>

<p>"Much. The regular troops are assisting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Tyrolese to hem in the enemy in the Lower Tyrol.
The <i>landsturm</i> from Meran and the Vintsghaw are
advancing on the right side of the Etsch; and
those of Etsch and Fleims are keeping the passes of
Rochetta and Bucco di Vela. Baron Hormayr and
Martin Teimer want General Chastelar to attack the
enemy in the Lower Tyrol at once; but he's too
slow, too slow. By not coming up in time, he let
us take Innsbruck without him: and Martin Teimer
won all the glory of making Bisson and Wrede lay
down their arms."</p>

<p>"Martin Teimer is no favourite of mine," said
Anna, pouring out the porridge.</p>

<p>"Ah, he has done good service, nevertheless.
General Chastelar finds fault with our training, calls
us round-shouldered, and who knows what?&mdash;and
wants to drill us a little. He won't be able to turn
a wild lark into a piping bulfinch, though, it's my
opinion. As long as we beat the enemy, what does
it signify how we do it? He is doing real good
service, however, by giving muskets to those who
have no fire-arms, but only spears and such like of
their own manufacture. Now, then, where are the
children?"</p>

<p>Theresa went to the door to give a jödel, which
would answer the purpose of a dinner-bell; but,
changing her purpose, returned, saying, "Father,
here is a young, olive-coloured man, who looks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
something like a soldier, coming up to the house;
in quest, apparently, of you."</p>

<p>Almost at the same instant, the young man
stepped in, taking off his cap and saluting Hofer in a
foreign accent as Signor Andrea.</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Come sta?</i>" returned Hofer, who rather piqued
himself on a smattering of Italian. "<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Sedete voi.
Andiamo pranzare&mdash;Fate lo stesso.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Mille grazie</i>," returned the youth, who, however,
preferred his own German to Hofer's Italian.
"The Signor Barone has sent me, Giuseppe Eisenstecken,
with the desire you will accept me as
adjutant."</p>

<p>"What want have I of an adjutant?" inquired
the Sandwirth. "What are you to do?"</p>

<p>"<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Che vi piace</i>," returned Giuseppe, spreading
out his hands; "I am quite at your service."</p>

<p>"But, my good lad, I don't want your services;
so where's the good?"</p>

<p>Giuseppe raised his eyebrows; then replied, "A
little training, the Signor Barone thought, would be
desirable for your men, and some small knowledge
of tactics for their chief."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear youth, you mean to flatten our
backs, I suppose, and turn out our toes; but when
you have lived as long in a mountainous country as
I have, you will find it more convenient, clambering
about among the crags, to round your shoulders and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
turn your toes in. Meanwhile, do as we do&mdash;<i>nulla
ceremonia!</i>&mdash;dine first, and talk afterwards. One
thing at a time will last the longer."</p>

<p>The young adjutant looked at first as if he hardly
knew how to take this; but at the same instant,
three rosy children ran in and flew into their father's
arms. While Hofer was embracing and kissing
them, Giuseppe looked on with some sympathy;
then, drawing a stool towards the table, he prepared
to accept the Sandwirth's invitation.</p>

<p>"So Baron Hormayr sent you to me?" said Hofer
presently. "Well, I wonder he said nothing about
you when I saw him."</p>

<p>"He has written," said Giuseppe, taking a note
out of his cap.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me that before?" said
Hofer. "Were you keeping it for dessert?"</p>

<p>"You said one thing at a time would last the
longer."</p>

<p>Hofer smiled, as he opened the note. "Well,"
said he, when he had read it; "it seems I had
hardly need to come home. Here am I wanted
again at head-quarters, to receive orders for immediate
action. We must put off our drilling, my
good friend, till another time. Why is this recall?"</p>

<p>"Since you left, we have received news of the
Archduke John's having won a brilliant victory at
Sacile."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aha! Our beloved <i>Hannes</i>! Heaven be praised,
I am ready to return immediately to the camp."</p>

<p>"Immediately?" said his wife, a little startled.</p>

<p>"Not till I have dined and had an hour's
sleep."</p>

<p>"One thing at a time will last the longer, Signor
Andrea."</p>

<p>"Just so, Signor Giuseppe. But come, tell me
about our Hannes' victory."</p>

<p>"He defeated Eugene Beauharnois on the 15th,
and compelled him to retire to Caldiero. That is all
I know."</p>

<p>"Hum! Not even how many men were slain?"</p>

<p>"No. The news had but just arrived."</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"You seem to have a good many targets."</p>

<p>"Ah, those are my coats of arms," said the Sandwirth,
supping his porridge.</p>

<p>"They seem to have been hit in the bull's eye
pretty often."</p>

<p>"Pretty often."</p>

<p>"By you?"</p>

<p>"By me."</p>

<p>"At how many paces?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred."</p>

<p>"You must be a pretty good marksman."</p>

<p>"Goodish; there are plenty as good or better in
the Tyrol. Did you hear that verse one of our men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
made the other day? General Marschall had observed
that we only beat the enemy by chance. On
which, our youngster observed&mdash;</p>

<div class="nobreak poem">
"''Tis but by chance,' doth Marschall say,<br />
'The Tyrolese have won the day.'<br />
What then? I'd rather win by chance<br />
Than, with much skill, be beat by France!<br />
</div>

<p>For where's the good of tactics, you know, master
Giuseppe, if they that have them are beat by the
unlearned?"</p>

<p>Giuseppe seemed engrossed in the merits of his
dinner. "I should like to see you fire at a mark,
Signor Andrea," said he at length.</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh! we have other things in hand,
brother. The way is long and steep. Are we
going to be sent into the south, think you?"</p>

<p>"To Trent, I conclude, but I only conjecture."</p>

<p>Hofer asked a few more questions, but he was not
a great talker at meal-times, though he ate with
great moderation. As soon as dinner was ended,
he took his hour's sleep, woke up fresh and strong,
and told his new adjutant he was ready for the
journey.</p>

<p>At every house or village they passed, he found
messengers to despatch to the men in the fields and
call them back from their husbandry to resume their
rifles. These came running along after him, some
swinging their coats on as they ran, others tightening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
their belts, others with their weapons not slung but
in their hands; all cheerfully obeying the summons
without murmuring at being disappointed of their
rest.</p>

<p>On Hofer's arrival at the camp, General Chastelar
instantly appointed him to the command of the
right wing, consisting of the men of Passeyr and of
Etschthal. Almost at the same moment, expresses
arrived to announce the disorderly retreat of the
French and Bavarians on the news of the Archduke's
victory, and of their destroying the bridges of Lavis
and Lorenzen.</p>

<p>"What are we to do, Hofer, without these
bridges?" said the General.</p>

<p>"I must think," said Hofer.</p>

<p>He thought so long, that Hormayr impatiently
whispered to Chastelar, "He is falling asleep&mdash;what
a dunderhead he is!"</p>

<p>But the good man was thinking to the purpose;
and, knowing the ground and the men who were on
it, he sat down and wrote two or three short notes,
and gave them to the General, saying:</p>

<p>"If you will send them, these will do."</p>

<p>"Had you not better go yourself?" put in Baron
Hormayr.</p>

<p>"Why?" said the Sandwirth. "I cannot be in
two places at once. If I were at Lavis, I could
not be at Lorenzen. These will do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps they will," muttered the General to the
Baron, who shrugged his shoulders. "See the
notes sent off."</p>

<p>"He knows when he's in good quarters, I believe,"
said Hormayr aside, as he passed the notes to
his inferior officer.</p>

<p>But others, of less note than a Roman centurion,
may have moral force enough to be able to say to
one man go, and he goeth; to another come, and he
cometh; to another, do this, and he doeth it.</p>

<p>Chastelar showed a vague sense of this when he
replied in an equally low tone to Hormayr, "It
matters little&mdash;his <em>name</em> will be enough."</p>

<p>How was it that that name came to be enough?
The name of another poor, honest man would not
have done as well.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 22d of April, the enemy
evacuated Trent without firing a shot; and Hormayr
took possession of the town the same evening.</p>

<p>The ancient city of Trent! Few need to be
reminded of the famous Council of purple cardinals,
princely bishops, mitred abbots, sandalled monks,
and learned doctors, assembled there by Charles the
Fifth, and prolonging their sitting for eighteen long
years.</p>

<p>"What a market," exclaims a writer, warming
with his subject, "the city must then have had!&mdash;what
cooks!&mdash;what convoys of sleek mules laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
with luxuries!&mdash;and how, in their distant and regretted
residences, all the old housekeepers of those
perplexed and provoked absentees must have busied
themselves in the preparation of savouries, and
potted meats, dried fruits, and delicate conserves,
and in the regular and never-failing despatch of supplies
from the well-stored cellars."</p>

<p>Trent is now said to be as dissolute a little capital
as any in Europe. The simplicity of ancient manners,
if it ever did exist there, is no longer to be
found. Even the characteristic honesty of the
Tyrolese has disappeared, and extortion and cheatery
are of common occurrence.</p>

<p>This was not the locality Hofer would willingly
choose for his <i>landsturm</i>. Fortunately, they were not
long exposed to its influence. On the 24th, General
Chastelar advanced towards Trent, while Hofer took
possession of the ground between Trent and Roveredo.
On the same day, Chastelar, after his
fatiguing march, was drawn into action by Baraguay
d'Hilliers, who, with a superior force, was victorious,
but reaped no advantage from it. He had already
abandoned Trent, and he now, immediately after the
battle, forsook Roveredo, and quitted the country
entirely.</p>

<p>Chastelar had scarcely taken up his quarters in
Roveredo, when he heard of the Austrians' reverses
in Germany and Italy. The north of the Tyrol was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
now left deserted, at the mercy of the enemy; and
he resolved immediately to return to it; invited
thereto by a note written by the Archduke John in
pencil on his knee, from the battle-field.</p>

<p>"Do not let our misfortunes make you uneasy.
We have done our duty, and will defend the Tyrol
to the last drop of our blood.</p>

GUERILLA WARFARE.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE rifles were soon in full action again. In the
course of a few days not a single town in the
Tyrol remained in the occupation of the French but
Kufstein.</p>

<p>Then came a reverse. The Austrians under
Chastelar were defeated at Worgl. This was on the
13th of May; and six days afterwards the Bavarians
burned Schwatz; while the flames of seventeen
other towns and villages made the heavens appear
a vast sea of fire.</p>

<p>In a certain mountain-pass several men were
vigorously felling down enormous larch-trees, evidently
for purposes of warfare, under the direction
of Father Joachim, who was zealously instructing
them where to place the trees with most effect; how
to intermix them with huge masses of rock, filling
up the interstices with earth and brushwood; and
how to secure the whole mass from toppling over
till the right moment, by means of cords and chains.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
In the midst of this exciting work a little boy came
trotting up to the good Capuchin.</p>

<p>"Father bade me find you," said he, panting, and
looking up at him with his clear, soft, black eyes,
"and tell you and the men you are wanted."</p>

<p>"What! to fight?"</p>

<p>"Father says the enemy are to be found at Berg
Isel. He and Hofer and Teimer will all meet there,
and they want you all to join them."</p>

<p>"We will come!"</p>

<p>And away ran little Speckbacher, sitting down
and sliding down the mountain-side wherever it was
not too rough, and getting on with amazing celerity.
Many of the men laughed, and followed his
example.</p>

<p>The child led the way, and an hour's fast walking
brought them within earshot of the rifles, the continual
report of which showed that the engagement
had begun. It was a severe and fatal one; but the
loss was almost entirely on the side of the enemy,
who were triumphantly defeated.</p>

<p>Little Anderl again hovered about, to see the issue
of the fight. He was now a regular and accredited
messenger among the Tyrolese, and was allowed by
his mother to go forth and bring her tidings of his
father, on condition of his keeping as much out of
danger as he could reasonably be expected to do.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, he had climbed a tree at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
some distance, and out of the direction of the firing,
from whence he got a good general idea of the
success of the engagement, without being close
enough to see the dreadful features of its details.
He now slid down from his perch, but, instead of
pursuing his father, paused when he had run a little
way; and after watching the retiring foemen till they
disappeared, prepared to run home and tell his
mother. A squall of wind and rain had come on,
and a flock of sheep rushed wildly past him.</p>

<p>Just then, he heard a groan close by him; and,
looking round, saw a Bavarian soldier who had been
shot down among the long coarse grass and underwood.
The poor young fellow did not look above
twenty; he had a boyish, simple face; his leg was
bleeding fast, and he had turned very white.</p>

<p>"Even such a little boy as I am could kill that
Bavarian," thought Anderl; "but I could not have
the heart to do it, even if the Sandwirth had not
said we must never hit a man when he is down.&mdash;Are
you in much pain?" said he, approaching him
with pity.</p>

<p>"I'm bleeding to death, I think," said the Bavarian;
"will you help me, you little chap? or are
you going to hurt me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Shall I tie up your leg with your handkerchief?
Mother would do it better, but I won't
hurt you, if I can help it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks, thanks! Oh, get me some water!"</p>

<p>Anderl knew where there was a spring, and he ran
and brought some in his hat.</p>

<p>"It is raining very hard," said he, "and there
is shelter not far off: do you think you can crawl
to it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll try&mdash;it's so forlorn to be left to die
here. You're not taking me to people that will
knock me on the head?" added he quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Not to any people at all, only to a
shepherd's deserted hut scooped out of the rock.
Edge yourself along this way, on your elbow and the
side that isn't bleeding. I know it will hurt you,
but you mustn't mind that."</p>

<p>Following the advice and guidance of the humane
little boy, the young Bavarian, with a good deal of
wincing, and some additional effusion of blood,
wormed himself along to the rude little cavity which
Anderl had dignified by the name of a hut. It
contained, however, a rough bed of fir branches, a
stool and table of rude construction, and a little
hidden store of rye-cakes and cheese.</p>

<p>"And now," said Anderl, after having good-naturedly
settled him on the rustic couch, and put
the food within his reach, "I'll fetch you some
water; and then I must leave you, or my mother will
fancy I've come to harm."</p>

<p>"I hope the owner of the hut will not return,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
though," said the Bavarian wistfully. "You couldn't
get me a musket, could you? I dare say mine is
down among the grass."</p>

<p>"Why, now, how can you expect it?" said the
boy. "Here have I had mercy on you, our enemy;
and you want me to give you the means of shooting
one of my friends!"</p>

<p>"But I'm so defenceless," suggested the Bavarian.</p>

<p>"Your safety lies in that," said Anderl. "If
any of our men should come and be unexpectedly
saluted by you with a shot, of course he would be
tempted to return your fire pretty effectually; but if
he finds you lying helpless as I did, he will have
compassion; because the Sandwirth told us this very
morning, that none but a coward would harm a
fallen foe."</p>

<p>"Come, that's one comfort," said the young
soldier. "Must you go?"</p>

<p>"Aye, that I must, but I'll come and look after
you in a day or two, if I can."</p>

<p>"Oh! I may be dead before that."</p>

<p>"Why, your leg has left off bleeding already, and
you have plenty to eat! What have you to do but
to lie still and get well? I don't think you are very
brave!"</p>

<p>This unexpected rebuke made the colour mount
in the young Bavarian's face; and Anderl, after
looking at him for a moment, turned away; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
taking a beechen bowl from a nail in the wall,
sallied forth to the spring and filled it to the brim
with water. "There, now," said he, smiling, as he
placed it beside the soldier, "do you feel all over
red-hot coals?"</p>

<p>"No; what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, Father Joachim says, 'If thine enemy
hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in
so doing, thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.'"</p>

<p>"Why, <em>I</em> am not your enemy, you little boy!
What harm have we ever done one another?"</p>

<p>"I've done <em>you</em> none, certainly; but you have
been killing my friends; and would gladly have
killed my father!"</p>

<p>"Who is your father?"</p>

<p>"I must not tell you that. However, I may tell
you that he is&mdash;oh, such a brave man! and so good!
Every one loves him."</p>

<p>"Hofer, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, not Hofer; but I must not tell you any
more, so now good bye. I don't think any one will
come near you&mdash;unless it should be the hill-sprite."</p>

<p>"Who is the hill-sprite?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't justly say; but he haunts the hill-top;
and when the herdsmen have gone down into
the valley for winter, he takes possession of one
of their deserted châlets,&mdash;to be more snug and
comfortable, I suppose, while nobody else wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
it; and, sometimes, when a herdsman has gone
back again for something he has forgotten, he has
found the hill-sprite already settling himself in the
châlet, and arranging his ghostly pans and pails."</p>

<p>"Hum! And are you going to leave me to the
mercy of this hill-sprite?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he won't hurt you. You got here first;
and if he looks in and sees you, he'll go away.
Shall you be frightened?"</p>

<p>"That depends. If he wears a green jacket and
red sash, and carries a rifle over his shoulder, very
likely I shall be."</p>

<p>"Not if he does not point it at <em>you</em>. Besides, it
wouldn't go off."</p>

<p>"I shan't understand his language."</p>

<p>"Why, you understand <em>mine</em>. But he doesn't
talk at all, only makes a dismal noise, and keeps
smiting his hands. I advise you to say your prayers,
and then you won't think of him any more."</p>

<p>Away went Anderl, with a very unfavourable
impression of Bavarian courage. Meanwhile, the
wounded soldier felt very lonely without his little
companion; and weak from the loss of blood. A
good deal of what courage he had, had certainly
ebbed away with it; for he was presently sadly
scared by a sudden, rushing, unaccountable sound
of many small feet, which he thought must be those
of a legion of hill-sprites rather than of one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>It only proceeded, however, from the flock of
sheep, who, having remained under the hill while
the spring storm lasted, were now returning to the
sweet short grass higher up.</p>

<p>A couple of days afterwards, Anderl, who had
often thought of the Bavarian, made up a little
packet of cakes and cheese, and set off on a walk of
several miles to see after him.</p>

<p class="center">
"The gate was there, but not the lad!"<br />
</p>

<p>Anderl looked about, but could find nothing of
him. The food was eaten, and he was gone.</p>

<p>It was best for all parties that he should have
made off. After a night's good sleep, he had awoke
sufficiently refreshed to make a hearty breakfast of
what would have fed a temperate Tyrolese for two
or three days; and then, examining his wound, he
found himself able to bind it up sufficiently well to
admit of his moving slowly, with a good deal of
limping.</p>

<p>He was very desirous of going down the ravine, to
hunt for his musket, but hardly felt equal to it; and
the sound of men's voices among the trees decided
him on keeping on his present level, and making off
as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Fear enabled him to do this better than he would
otherwise have thought possible; and he made
considerable progress along the mountain-side, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
he began to be uncertain of his bearings, and to
fear that he might be penetrating into the enemy's
country instead of getting out of it. Besides, he
was by this time very tired and very hungry; and it
was therefore with considerable though not unmixed
satisfaction that he descried a lone hut. Though
lonely, it might not be unoccupied; therefore, he
approached it with extreme caution.</p>

<p>On close investigation, however, there appeared
no signs of life. Made bold by hunger, he raised
the latch; went in and found the hut empty&mdash;empty
of inhabitants, that is, but not of stock; for
it appeared to be a kind of little shop or store,
containing medicines for man, horse, and cow;
cheap crockery and cutlery; sieves, tubs, and pails;
household and agricultural implements; and a few
rolls of green cloth, canvas, and calico; such goods
as the peasantry were likely to want during the long
winter months, without finding it convenient to go
to a town for them. Every article was ticketed
with the price; there was a till for the money, and
a book wherein to enter what had been purchased.
These good, honest people could rely upon not being
defrauded by one another!</p>

<p>It struck the Bavarian; though not so much as it
would strike us. He opened the till; there was a
little heap of kreutzers in it,&mdash;and shut it up again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
He looked into the ledger, and read such entries as
these&mdash;</p>

<div class="bq">
"Walter Landauer; a Dutch hoe (so many kreutzers).<br />
Adolf Winkel, three yds. green cloth.<br />
Madeline Weiss, 2 yds. scarlet ribbon.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ditto.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 oz. coarse white thread.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ditto.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1 small hair sieve.</span><br />
Jerome Brinkel, a brush of hog's hair bristles."<br />
</div>

<p class="uni">and so forth.</p>

<p>The Bavarian began to look about for something
to eat. He found unroasted coffee in the berry, tar,
turpentine, oil, black and yellow paint, and cobbler's
wax; none of which articles, separately or conjointly,
promised a very desirable repast, even if
there were a fire lighted by which to cook them.
At length he came to a small canister of sugar-plums
and poured its contents into his pocket, that his
mouth might not be altogether unemployed, if he
could find nothing better to fill it.</p>

<p>Just then he heard a loud exclamation of surprise;
and, with a guilty start, he turned about and met
the great, round, wondering eyes of a stout, thickset
girl, who looked as if she were not quite sure of his
not being the hill-sprite.</p>

<p>His start, and the uniform he wore, seemed to
undeceive her; for she accosted him with an ejaculation
tantamount to</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure!&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty maiden, does this shop belong to you?"
said the Bavarian.</p>

<p>"No more than it does to you!" said she,
planting herself boldly in the door-way. "How
durst you come here?"</p>

<p>"I am a wounded man&mdash;don't you see?" (pointing
to his bandage) "and a stranger. Women
always have pity on the unfortunate."</p>

<p>"How do I know you're unfortunate? You are
a thief! you were eating Hans Steffan's sugar-plums!"</p>

<p>"Because I was starving."</p>

<p>"Were you?" relenting a little.</p>

<p>"I can't think what I shall do."</p>

<p>"What do you want to do?"</p>

<p>"To get out of the Tyrol as quick as I can."</p>

<p>"You may do that in a few hours, if you look
sharp."</p>

<p>"But I am wounded, and cannot walk fast."</p>

<p>"Humph&mdash;poor fellow! And you are hungry?"</p>

<p>"As a hunter."</p>

<p>"Humph!&mdash;Well,&mdash;here's some bread and
cheese I was carrying to my father; you can have
it, and I will fetch him some more. And now I
advise you to be off as fast as you can&mdash;<em>I</em> will pay
for the sugar-plums. That is, supposing you have
no money."</p>

<p>"Not a kreutzer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well; here are a couple of kreutzers for you.
Now, off."</p>

<p>"Which way?"</p>

<p>"Right towards that old tower on the distant
hill. When you reach it you will get a distant view
of Innsbruck, which of course you will keep clear of,
as we have re-taken it!"</p>

<p>"Have you!"</p>

<p>"That have we. Now depart."</p>

<p>"Gracious maiden, permit me&mdash;" He saluted
her on the cheek.</p>

<p>She watched him down the hill, and then turned
on her heel, with an ejaculatory "Humph!&mdash;what
manners!"</p>

TYROLESE COURTSHIP.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">A</span> YOUNG man is busily examining the water-worn
rocks along the edge of a Tyrolese
stream. Now and then he strikes them with a large
sledge-hammer, eagerly snatches up something alive,
and pops it into a basket. A wild <i>jödel</i> from a
mountain-side, half a mile off, makes him look up,
and discovers the face of our old, but not very
respectable, acquaintance, Franz.</p>

<p>The wild cry was uttered by a girl, who, in course
of time, drew near him, knitting as she came along;
for a Tyrolese woman never is idle.</p>

<p>"What are you about there, Franz?"</p>

<p>"Can't you see, Theresa? Look at that nice
basket of fish."</p>

<p>"How can you be about such nonsense, when
every man deserving the name of a man is up in
arms? I am quite ashamed of you!"</p>

<p>"Well, Theresa, you are not over-polite; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
don't you know that some must plough, and some
must sow, and some must handle the mattock and
hoe?"</p>

<p>"Well, all I can say is, I think it very contemptible
of you!"</p>

<p>"Why, now, Theresa, I call that very unkind!
Do you know I was catching these smelts on purpose
for you?"</p>

<p>"I would not give a pin for them; I am not
dainty in my eating, and if I were, we have plenty
of good trout in the Passeyr, to be caught at our
own door."</p>

<p>"These would fetch a good price in Innsbruck
market, I can tell you!"</p>

<p>"Then you had better carry them to Innsbruck
market. Only, take care none of our Passeyrers ask
you where you have been these three days."</p>

<p>"Why, Theresa, how bitter you are! You've
never had a civil word to say to me since I beat
Rudolf at bowls."</p>

<p>"<em>You?</em> Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em>, though!"</p>

<p>"Very likely you might; but I have forgotten all
about it. People that attend to nothing but hammering
stones for smelts, and playing bowls and
ninepins, are likely to excel in such things."</p>

<p>"I do attend to a precious lot of things besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Oh, looking after the cows, and smuggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
brandy, and selling bad horses for good ones&mdash;well,
you do all that, I allow."</p>

<p>Franz did not answer her for a few minutes, but
leapt actively from rock to rock along the stream;
darting here and there on a smelt, and coming back
with his hands full.</p>

<p>"There!" said he, throwing them into the basket;
"perhaps your mother will accept them of me, if
you won't; so I'll carry them to her, and we can
walk along together. I've a word or two to say to
you."</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Theresa, pursuing her knitting,
and stepping out at a good pace.</p>

<p>"All that you said just now," rejoined he, after
a short silence, "about my getting brandy, and
selling horses, and looking after cows,&mdash;to which you
might have added doctoring them when ill,&mdash;is true
enough, Theresa; and what is more, it has put a
goodish bit of money into my pocket."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Theresa; "but what of that?
Money is not the thing of most consequence in the
world."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> almost think it is."</p>

<p>"It is of much consequence, certainly, Franz, in
<em>this</em> way, I grant you,&mdash;the way it is employed,&mdash;whether
good or evil. If it enables (and inclines)
you to be generous and helpful to your poor old
blind mother, and your hard-working sister, it is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
instrument of good; but if you only hide it in a
hole, it is of no good at all; and if you spend it in
betting and drinking, it is worse than no good, for it
is downright evil."</p>

<p>"All that is very well to say,"&mdash;began Franz.</p>

<p>"Nothing is very well to say, unless it be true,"
interrupted Theresa.</p>

<p>"But it's quite certain," continued Franz, "that
money is a real good, whether or no: and for this
plain reason&mdash;that it gives you <em>power</em>."</p>

<p>"Power of some sort," said Theresa.</p>

<p>"Almost endless power," returned Franz, warming
with his subject. "Why, now, how could
Buonaparte carry on this war without money?"</p>

<p>"Without wit, rather," said Theresa. "I never
heard that he was very rich to start with, but quite
the reverse; the thing was, <em>he had a clever head, and
made use of it</em>. He was very pains-taking, very
resolute; and that has made him so powerful; not
money."</p>

<p>"It has put him in possession of money, without
which he could not pay his troops," argued Franz;
"and if they were not paid, they would not fight
for him."</p>

<p>"Not they! I believe you there," said Theresa.
"They have not the motives for fighting that we
poor Tyrolese have; and that is why we so often
beat them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, but, Theresa, when I began to speak about
money, I did not mean to get into this long argument.
What I was going to tell you,&mdash;(in confidence,
you know,)&mdash;is that I've a goodish bit of
money underground, in a pot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, there it will rot!"</p>

<p>"No, it won't! It will increase!"</p>

<p>"What! like a grain of corn? Franz, I wonder
how you can tell such stories!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say like corn. It will increase, because
I shall put more to it."</p>

<p>"Oh! that's one way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, and that one way will suffice. Why should
we try a dozen roads, when one leads to the mill?
Now, Theresa, listen to me. I've had a dream&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Humph!"</p>

<p>"And I dreamed that I was in a certain spot,
which I shall not now disclose; and that I saw a
cloud of golden dollars floating in the air before me,
just out of my reach&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I should think so!"</p>

<p>"Why, that's the beauty of it!" cried Franz,
highly excited.</p>

<p>"Is it?" said Theresa, looking mystified.</p>

<p>"Yes; because it's a known thing among the
wise ones, that when gold pieces glitter before you
in that way in the air, the spot they hover over is
where hidden treasure is to be found."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are the 'wise ones?'"</p>

<p>"Oh, there are many old people that can tell
about dreams."</p>

<p>"A good many," said Theresa, dryly. "Well,
Franz, I hope you won't go wasting your time
digging for this hid treasure. You had much better
hoe potatoes."</p>

<p>"I don't think so," said Franz; "and I hope you
won't think so, if I tell you my motive."</p>

<p>"What motive?" said Theresa.</p>

<p>"That I may be rich enough to marry you."</p>

<p>Theresa turned very red, and then burst out
laughing.</p>

<p>"Franz," said she, "don't deceive yourself about
that, for <em>I'll</em> not deceive you! I would not marry
you if you were made of money. I must have a
husband of quite another sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rudolf, in short," cried Franz, angrily.</p>

<p>"We are not talking of Rudolf," returned Theresa,
turning yet redder. "There are some people that
never can believe you don't like them, without it's
being the fault of somebody else, instead of their
own. If I had never seen any other young man
in the world, Franz, I should not choose to marry
you."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now, Theresa!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's the truth! You have not those qualities
which I love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are those qualities?" said Franz, very
crustily.</p>

<p>"Spirit; self-denial; temperance; a modest
opinion of yourself; generosity; truth; charitable
feelings towards others."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there's a fellow with all you
want under the sun," said Franz, aiming a stone at
that luminary. "If you'd mentioned one thing, I
might have tried to acquire it for your sake; but
such a lot of them,&mdash;no, thank you! the reward
wouldn't be worth the trouble: and besides, I know
I could not accomplish it; so there's no use in
trying."</p>

<p>"But, Franz, what a bad case you make out for
yourself, if you own you are deficient in all these
things."</p>

<p>"I'm not! I've as many of them as anybody
else; but what you want is perfection, and that's
what's not to be found. You may <em>fancy</em> you find
it, if a fellow pleases you in something else,&mdash;white
teeth, or black eyes, or a smart jacket, or nobody
knows what; but he won't <em>be</em> perfection any the
more for all that. And I'm just as honest and fair-dealing
as other people, and just as much liked, and
not at all intemperate; and as for spirit,&mdash;ho! if
Rudolf stood here between me and the edge of the
cliff this minute, wouldn't I tip him over it, that's
all!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Franz, you think to intimidate me, but you only
fill me with disgust. What good could you hope to
reap by such a dreadful piece of cruelty? On the
contrary, nothing would ever prosper in your hands
afterwards. Do you remember those two young men,
both in love with the same girl, who went out together
one day to take an eagle's nest? One returned, the
other did not: the fact was, one had let down his
companion from the top of the cliff to the nest, and
then drawn up the rope, and left him to starve, or
be torn to pieces by the parent-birds. Think what
a miserable end he himself came to afterwards!"</p>

<p>"Ah, there's no knowing what a fellow may be
driven to, when he's jealous," said Franz, after a
pause&mdash;"It's best not to make him desperate."</p>

<p>"He had better not allow himself to become
desperate."</p>

<p>"Well, Theresa, here we come to two paths,&mdash;one
leads to the Wirthhaus, the other does not;
which shall I take?"</p>

<p>"Whichever you like; it is quite indifferent to
me. The path is yours as much as mine."</p>

<p>"If I take the path to the Wirthhaus, I shall still
try and hope to make myself agreeable to you. If
I take the path to the left, I shall renounce you for
ever!"</p>

<p>"You had better, then, take the path to the left."</p>

<p>"Fish and all?" holding the basket a little towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
her, but as if his elbow were tied to his
side.</p>

<p>"Fish and all," said Theresa, without intermitting
her knitting.</p>

<p>"Then farewell, Theresa, for ever!" cried Franz,
in a tone intended to be fiercely tragic. "You have
had your last chance of me!" And shouldering his
smelts, he strode off.</p>

<p>He was in a very tempestuous state of mind; and
many things Theresa had said had cut him more
deeply than she thought; but to no good purpose.
When a stone came tumbling upon him from the
mountain-top, he shook his fist savagely, and
muttered, "Even the little people" (<i>i. e.</i> fairies)
"are against me!"&mdash;and then, considering that if
he provoked them, they might lead him a weary
dance after the hidden treasure, he muttered a spell
supposed to have a propitiating effect.</p>

<p>As the pass widened, he beheld from the height
on which he stood, Innsbruck, white and nest-like,
basking in the valley afar off, and turned in his mind
whether it were worth his while to carry thither the
fish we have called smelts for want of an English
name for them.</p>

<p>"But no," thought he, "the Sandwirth is again
in the town, and I don't care to see him just now,
Theresa thinks his luck uppermost, I fancy, and
believes he will be made a great general or governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and that he will marry her to Rudolf, and make him
a great man too. She has her own dreams, though
she laughs at mine. No, I'll not go; some of my
speaking-acquaintance might put the saucy question
she spitefully suggested; and even if I got a zwanziger
or more for my smelts, it would be very great
trouble for very little money. My time will be
much better and more pleasantly employed in
digging for the pot of gold; for when I've got that,
I may pay zwanzigers for smelts myself, if I like;
and meantime, I'll sup on those I've caught myself,
and eat them with plenty of brown bread and butter&mdash;thin
brown bread and thick yellow butter&mdash;as
yellow as a cowslip! aye, that's it!"</p>

<p>Rejoicing that Theresa had not accepted the
smelts, since she had not accepted himself, this
worthy son of Tyrol wended his way home.
How he would have licked his lips if he had been
told the story related by Bridel, of that golden age
when cows were so large and yielded such abundance
of milk, that they were milked into reservoirs or
ponds, from which the cream was afterwards
skimmed by a man in a boat, (a butter-boat, of
course!) which boat, once upsetting, the man could
not be found for a long time afterwards, till, at
length, his body was discovered sticking in the
immense mass of cream, like a smothered fly!</p>

<p>Before Franz reached home, he encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Lenora in the cow-pastures. She was knitting with
all her might, which did not hinder her eyes from
roving over hill and valley, and noting the smallest
movement within their range. Consequently, she
soon espied her brother, whom she saluted with a
shrill <i>jödel</i> that let him know he was recognised;
otherwise he would gladly have gone a little out of
his way to escape the interview, as she was one of
those who not only do their own duties vigorously,
but insist on other people doing theirs.</p>

<p>"Come here, Franz," cried she, as soon as he
drew near. "You have not done a stroke of work
to-day. To-morrow you must look after the stock."</p>

<p>"Well, the day after to-morrow, I will."</p>

<p>"Why not to-morrow? I want to take my
mother to the shrine of St. Kummernitz, to try if it
will do her eyes any good, and I can't look after her
and the cows too."</p>

<p>"But there's going to be a peasant-play, to-morrow,&mdash;Joseph
and his Brethren, and I'm wanted
to play one of the brethren."</p>

<p>"Truly, I think there might be a better time of
year than this for a peasant-play, when we are short
of hands at every kind of work. Who has proposed
such nonsense?"</p>

<p>"Leopold Strauss is going to marry Bianca
Gessner&mdash;the play is only going to be got up by her
bridesmaids and a few of the bridegroom's friends&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"But you are not one of them, and we are not
related to the bride."</p>

<p>"No, but all his friends are gone to fight, and
they can't make up the party without me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;I should think it no great honour to go,
under those circumstances; but you will do as you
like. The day after to-morrow, then, I may rely
upon you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may rely upon me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You promise me faithfully&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promise you faithfully. And, Lenora, I have
bought a new ribbon for my hat: do tie it round for
me, there's a good girl&mdash;you can tie a bow so much
better than I can&mdash;and let me have a nice nosegay."</p>

<p>"Nonsense; you can gather your own nosegay.
I shall soon have all your things to look up for the
châlet&mdash;the cows' bells must be rubbed up, and
their straps embroidered; you might and ought to
have cleaned the bells and trappings yourself, if it
were not for this wedding, which no way concerns
you."</p>

<p>"Who knows, Lenora? I may pick up a rich wife
at it&mdash;Bianca has six sisters, who are going to play
the six youngest brethren, and I shall have plenty
of opportunities of making myself agreeable!"</p>

<p>"You? Why, you have always talked of meaning
to marry Theresa Hofer!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"She won't suit me," said Franz contemptuously;
"I may do better for myself than that, I fancy."</p>

<p>"I doubt it very much. More likely, you don't
suit <em>her</em>."</p>

<p>"That just shows how much you know about it.
You girls think you may have anybody you like!&mdash;Well,
don't let us talk any more of this nonsense;
but come and cook these smelts for supper; and
then I'll give you my hat to trim."</p>

<p>"That's just like one of your givings: here&mdash;give
me your hat, and do you drive in the cows."</p>

<p>Franz would have liked her to do <em>both</em>, but he
knew that was too much to expect; so he gave her
the hat and the basket of fish, and prepared to
collect the herd.</p>

<p>When Lenora reached the cottage, she found
rather a pleasant-looking man talking to her mother.</p>

<p>"Here comes Lenora, I can tell, though I can't
see," said he. "Lenora, I am telling your mother
she is better off than I am, for she is only almost
blind, but I am quite; and yet I contrive to find
my way by myself from Meran to Innsbruck every
summer, to tune the pianos."</p>

<p>"Ah, there must be a special providence over
you, Karl," said Lenora compassionately, "or you
would come to some hurt."</p>

<p>"I know there must be," said he devoutly.
"However, now and then, some good Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
soul meets me and leads me by the hand along some
difficult pass; but they are sent by God."</p>

<p>"You should marry, Karl," said the old woman,
"and then your wife would lead you."</p>

<p>"Who would marry a poor blind fellow like me?"
said Karl, rather sadly. "No, no; I must be content
with chance kindnesses."</p>

<p>"Well, you are sure to be welcome, wherever
you go," said Lenora cheerfully. "And you shall
have a dainty supper to-night, for Franz has caught
some delicate fish."</p>

<p>"Your mother tells me she's going to St. Kummernitz's
shrine, for the benefit of her eyes," said
Karl. "I never heard St. Kummernitz was particularly
famous for that."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's famous for everything," cried the old
woman, in a sort of ecstasy; "dear blessed Saint!
she cured me once of the toothache!"</p>

<p>"You're a bit of a heretic, I fear," said Lenora
gravely. "You have been too long at Geneva."</p>

<p>"Well, certainly, this saint of yours seems to
have rather an incredible legend. Your mother tells
me, she was a famous opera-dancer some thousand
years or so ago, and was so persecuted by the admiration
her personal charms called forth, that she
prayed she might be made less attractive. On
which, rather to her dismay, a beard began to sprout
from her chin, accompanied by a very bushy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
moustache over her upper lip, which effectually
extinguished the ardour of her lovers; and though
she has been dead so many years, the beard continues
to grow to this day!"</p>

<p>"Well, and what of that?" cried the old woman.</p>

<p>Karl smiled; but the entrance of Franz caused a
change in the subject of conversation.</p>

BERG ISEL.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">W</span>HAT a horrible place is Halle! Enveloped
in a dense atmosphere of smoke, the sunbeams
vainly endeavour to pour more than a
sombre light into the sooty streets, in which houses,
people, and everything else, have, unavoidably, an
air of griminess inseparable from a large manufacturing
town; and the amusing spectacle is too
often seen of some honest fellow walking along in
the mistaken belief of having a clean face, while,
all the time, a black has settled on his nose.</p>

<p>It was towards the close of the merry month of
May. The struggle at Berg Isel had taken place on
the 26th, and on the following day a man was to be
seen rapidly skirting the mountains that bound
Halle to the north, along the edge of a ravine, in
the depths of which brawled an impetuous torrent.
His green coat and red sash might have been those
of any Tyrolese; but his dark beard showed him to
be no other than Hofer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>He stepped out, mile after mile, along the
steep path towards the famous salt-mines. Huge
masses of rock, hanging over his head, seemed
suspended by little short of a miracle; dark pine-forests
clothed the rugged cliffs, cascades dashed
from innumerable heights, some close by the path,
others heard thundering above; the foaming torrent
was here and there spanned by bridges of snow,
while huge, unmelted avalanches lay in its bed.</p>

<p>As Hofer proceeded, he came up with a tall,
dark, athletic man, going towards the mines. When
he got close to him, he grasped his shoulder. The
man started, turned round, and joyfully embraced
him.</p>

<p>"Praised be the name of our Lord!" said he.</p>

<p>"Amen, and Amen!" said Hofer, raising his
hat. "Brother, what a dance you have led me!
They told me in Halle you had just delivered a load
of wood, and I should find you here. But what?
can you spare leisure to carry wood in these
times?"</p>

<p>"A contract must be fulfilled," said Speckbacher.
"I contracted, before the war broke out,
to supply the works with a certain quantity of wood
in a certain time. This has been my last journey,
I am happy to say&mdash;my man Zoppel will drive the
oxen after to-day, and the contract expires within
a week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is well, for there is plenty for you to do.
We expect to make head against the enemy to-morrow,
and you must join us with the men of the
lower Innthal."</p>

<p>"Surely. Where are we to march?"</p>

<p>"On Innsbruck."</p>

<p>"Capital! Teimer joins us, of course?"</p>

<p>"With the men of the upper Inn. I shall
occupy Mount Brenner, ready to drop down on the
city. The regulars, under General Buol, will be
higher up. Father Joachim will head the peasants
on Berg Isel."</p>

<p>"Come, we ought to succeed this time. I hope
we shall not only take the city, but keep it better
than we did before. Father Joachim has sent me
an amulet, to keep me from harm. Do you think
there's anything in it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;what know I? This I know&mdash;the Lord
of hosts has protected you and me, my friend,
through many dangers, thus far, without e'er an
amulet; so I hope He will continue to do so
henceforth."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes. Maria wished me to wear it, so I
thought it would do no harm&mdash;it makes her easy,
you know."</p>

<p>"There's something that would make me easy,
my brother, if you will yield to me&mdash;let us seek the
blessing of God in prayer."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, if you wish it."</p>

<p>They were just in front of a rude cross, sculptured
on the face of the rock. The two men knelt, and
fervently prayed aloud, each in turn, for some
minutes. Hofer rose, looking comforted.</p>

<p>"I'm all the better for that," said Speckbacher,
heartily.</p>

<p>"How can it be otherwise, brother? God has
bidden us cast our care upon Him; it is our own
fault if we do it not."</p>

<p>They proceeded on their way.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Chastelar ever kneels down and
prays as we have just done," said Speckbacher presently.</p>

<p>"There's no saying, brother; I should hope he
does. There seems to me to be little praying in
camps. Men touch their hats as they pass a picture
or a crucifix&mdash;that is pretty nearly all; outwardly, at
least, which is all we can judge from. But sure I
am, that those who prayed often&mdash;from the heart,
look you,&mdash;would not take God's holy name in vain."</p>

<p>"How the French curse and swear, Hofer! and
yet they say, many of them, there's no God. They
laugh at us for praying for success, because they say
they have it without."</p>

<p>"Pity, brother, they have not something better to
laugh about. Ah, God <em>does</em> give his foes success
sometimes, and deprive his children of it; but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
because He does not hear and answer prayer. He
never permits their success, and our defeat, save for
our good. Why now, has He not said He will try
us seven times in the fire? First, may be, He tests
our courage; well, we prove to have it: then our
love; well, we have some, though it were to be
wished we had more. Then, our faith; very little
is found. Into the fire we must go. By and by,
our unfaithfulness is somewhat purged away. Well,
but then, may be, he tries our submission; finds it
very poor. Into the fire with us! After that, our
patience. Oh, perhaps a great, thick scum boils up
to the top of the pot, and shows how far from perfection
we are yet. Instead of setting us aside to
cool, he stirs up the fire hotter and hotter, never
minding our boiling and bubbling, so long as we
don't boil over. Well, supposing fused metal had
the feelings of a man, just fancy its state! At
last the scum parts! the pure, bright silver appears!&mdash;he
stoops over it, sees in it <em>his own face</em>,&mdash;takes us
to heaven!"</p>

<p>"Oh me! I don't believe I could stand all that!"
cried Speckbacher, turning pale. "You might, but
I couldn't!"</p>

<p>"God only knows our hearts," replied the Sandwirth.
"You and I may lie stark and stiff before
another night; but what then? we shall be with
Him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"May it please Him, we shall," said Speckbacher,
devoutly crossing himself.</p>

<p>"Sandwirth," cried he, after a pause, "what a
life mine has been! Oh, when I think of the sins
of my youth, I see what a long, long chain must be
let down from heaven, to draw me up to it! What
could you expect from me, poor little orphan as I
was at seven years old, but that I should go astray
like a youngling of the flock, whose mother has fallen
over the cliff? My relations were severe: I had no
happiness in the house: so I sought it out of it.
Evil companions fell in my way, and tried to make
me as wicked as themselves. They feared no God;
what wonder they feared no man? We robbed, we
gamed, we drank; we sang, told jolly tales, and
made merry; but I never was happy.</p>

<p>"One day we were on a predatory expedition.
I had separated a little from the rest, when I heard
an inexpressibly mournful cry; it seemed to say,
'Oh, woe, woe, woe!' I stood fixed to the spot;
my blood ran cold: at length I hurried on to join my
comrades, and begged them to turn back to hearken
to a cry of distress in the wood. They treated it
with indifference, and said we must push on, there was
no time to lose. I, however, lingered; then turned
back. Following the sound, which became more
and more lamentable, I suddenly almost toppled over
the edge of a tremendous cliff, seven hundred feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
high! It took me so by surprise that I shrank back,
appalled and breathless. Half way down hung a
miserable man, one of our company whom we had
not missed, whose clothes, as he fell, had been
caught by some projection in the rock, and who was
nearly doubled in half, his head towards his toes,
with horrible death beneath him. I shouted, 'Don't
fear! I'll run for aid!' and did so, without knowing
whether he heard me or not. But when, after a long
run, I came in sight of my comrades, they were in
the hands of justice, and I was the only one that
escaped. I flew back to the edge of the cliff. The
poor wretch's slight support had given way, and he
lay, a mangled mass of bones and blood, at the
bottom. When I came to myself,&mdash;oh, Hofer, can
you wonder I was another man?"</p>

<p>Speckbacher's feelings here so overcame him that
he leant against the rock a moment for support.</p>

<p>"Doubtless the hand of the Lord was in the
event, brother," said Hofer. "To the one He showed
judgment, to the other mercy."</p>

<p>"Mercy? Yes, what mercy! He drew me into
the way of the Schmeiders, a family of piety and of
love. Soon I felt their softening influence; at length
I became their inmate. The old man had known
my father; he interested himself in getting me employed
in supplying wood to the salt-works. After
a time, he saw a growing affection between Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and me: he did not discourage it; he told me I
should marry her. I told him how bad I had been;
he would not recall his promise, but fixed a time,
and said that if I continued steady till then, we
should be united. And so we were. Ah! God be
praised!"</p>

<p>Some men, coming from the mines, here approached
and passed them, which changed the
subject of conversation.</p>

<p>"Has General Chastelar forgiven the men of
Halle for drubbing him yet?" said Speckbacher.</p>

<p>"Why, he cannot be expected to forget it very
readily," said Hofer. "It was a bad business, and
did them no credit, I think. The poor general had
had his turn of ill luck, and could hardly have been
better pleased at his defeat than we were; but did
that authorize a set of angry fellows to waylay him
with cudgels, and thump him so that he was obliged
to keep his bed two days? No, no, I say."</p>

<p>"I can't help laughing at it, though," said Speckbacher;
"it was taking the law so into their own
hands. His ardour for us was already beginning to
cool; and, for my part, I think he has done us very
little good, from first to last. But here we are. I was
on my way to the superintendent; but you have
never seen the mines: would not you like to do
so?"</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come this way, then&mdash;I will find you a miner's
overcoat and staff. They will give us flambeaux."</p>

<p>Hofer presently found himself descending the
noted three hundred steps, with considerable excitement,
and a little trepidation. He seemed entering
a new world, the withdrawal of daylight from
which gave it something inexpressibly dismal. The
interminable galleries and caverns, the unfathomed
lakes, the dim lights, the hollow, unearthly sounds,
sensibly affected his imagination; and when they
now and then came up to a solitary miner, with his
little candle, constantly striking his axe into the wall
before him, a profound feeling of pity towards him
oppressed his kind heart.</p>

<p>"It is wonderful! truly wonderful!" ejaculated
he, as they once more emerged into the warm sunlight;
"but I am very glad to find myself out of it.
I could not help thinking of poor wretches in the
bottomless pit."</p>

<p>"Hofer! when you were comparing the true believer,
just now, to metal molten over the fire, I
could not help thinking that their foes are like the
crackling sticks in that fire, that help to heat the
silver. They are <em>unintelligent agents</em>; they make a
great blaze, and shine very bright, for a little while.
How soon they become extinct!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I never like to think of it,&mdash;it melts me
with sorrow. If the true believer has such a hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
fight of it, where shall the ungodly and sinner
appear? Brother, let us leave such matters to the
God who made those salt caverns. I thought, before
I entered them, they would afford me a good
opportunity for some more talk with you about to-morrow;
but when I was once within them, the God
of nature made me hold my peace."</p>

<p>"Here is a niche, Anderl, where we can sit and
talk our fill. It seems to me we shall very likely
fall short of powder and bullets&mdash;what can we do?"</p>

<p>They sat down and arranged, as well as they
could, the plans for the morrow. But they were,
after all, unskilled tacticians, as far as science went:
men rather of deeds than words, who felt a certain
consciousness of what they themselves could do, and
what they could expect from one another. However,
before they parted, they had decided their own parts
in what proved to be the most important struggle
that occurred during the Tyrolean war.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 29th, both parties were
prepared to try their strength&mdash;the Bavarians with
all the advantages of regular training and skill; the
Tyrolese armed with valour and love of their freedom
and their country. Seventeen thousand peasants,
badly accoutred for war, scantily provided with ammunition,
and headed not by one but by several chiefs,
were supported by a thousand Austrian regulars,
sixty or seventy horse, and five pieces of cannon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>General Deroy opposed them with eight thousand
Bavarian infantry, one thousand cavalry, and twenty-five
cannon.</p>

<p>Hofer slept overnight at a little tavern called the
Spade, a short distance from Innsbruck. He and
his men began the day with a hearty meal, which
some who had three or four good meals every day of
their lives, afterwards called "carousing:"&mdash;and on
this splendid carouse of bread, cheese, and beer, the
brave men, commending their good cause to Heaven,
started forth to the field. Speckbacher, however,
had opened the day on the bridge of Halle, which
was obstinately contested, but which he carried;
and the engagement then became general. The
peasantry led by Father Joachim poured down from
the Iselberg, and attacked the Bavarians with fury,
while Teimer fell on them from the rear.</p>

<p>"The Bavarians," says a writer, "had every
advantage on their side, except their numbers."
We may add, and except their cause. They had
passed the night quietly in and about Innsbruck,
had an ample supply of provisions, while the
Tyrolese had only their little meal-bags; and were
well armed, while many of the Tyrolese were
provided with nothing better than pitchforks or
scythes. Under all these circumstances, it is surprising,
says the above-quoted chronicler, that the
Bavarians suffered themselves to be brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
action; or that, being engaged, they should sustain
a defeat. Yes, very surprising, no doubt; and
equally surprising that Baron Hormayr returned no
answers to Hofer's repeated and urgent missives,
during several previous days, to advance to support
the Tyrolese: and that when, somewhat tardily, he
moved from his quarters at Landeck, he only proceeded
to Imst, where he lay in bed for a sore
throat. He had taken a chill.</p>

<p>Meantime, Speckbacher, with six hundred men,
having carried the bridge, had thrice dislodged the
Bavarians from the farm of Rainerhof, twice been
driven out, and the third time triumphantly taken it:
earning for himself from the other side the questionable
title of the Fire-devil. The owners of the farm
were in it all the time. A girl named Lisa, seeing
Speckbacher's lips dry and parched, exclaimed,
"That brave man shall not die of thirst if I can
help it"&mdash;and carrying out a small cask of wine
into the midst, she began to dispense its contents in
a mug, first to him and then to his comrades, when
a bullet struck the cask and made a small orifice
near the spiggot. Thrusting her thumb into the
hole, she cried, laughing, "Come, men, drink fast, or
it will run out quicker than I can stop it!"</p>

<p>Father Joachim, flying about the field, shouting
to his men and brandishing aloft his huge ebony
crucifix, performed, it is said, prodigies of valour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and generalship. He was humane, too, binding up
wounds, whispering brief absolution into the ears of
the dying; and once, at least, narrowly escaped
death himself, for a Bavarian was about to run him
through the body with his bayonet, when he himself
was brought down by a rifle.</p>

<p>Hofer did not come up till some hours later, but
then turned the fortune of the day. Somewhat
after him arrived Martin Teimer, on the heights of
Hotting; on seeing whom, the Bavarians advanced
with great resolution on the Iselberg. The Austrians,
under Colonel Ertel, who were somewhat dispersed,
drew up in haste to receive them, supported by a
large body of Tyrolese, and the Bavarians maintained
the contest for some time with great gallantry; but
the Tyrolese sharpshooters among the rocks thinned
their ranks so formidably that their destruction
would have been inevitable, had not the peasants
fallen short of ammunition. An officer with a
trumpet was therefore despatched to the Bavarian
commander, advising him to lay down his arms;
and, as he had just heard that one of his outposts
had been carried by the Austrians, he conceded a
suspension of hostilities for twenty-four hours, and,
under cover of the night, effected a precipitate
retreat, leaving the Tyrolese complete masters of the
field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aha," said Speckbacher, shaking his fist at
some ammunition-wagons which now, rather too
tardily, loomed large in the distance,&mdash;"had you
come up a little sooner.... But, no matter&mdash;Innsbruck
is a second time ours!"</p>

THE LATTER END OF A FRAY, AND THE BEGINNING
OF A FEAST.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE loss of the Tyrolese amounted to sixty-two
killed and ninety-seven wounded; of their
friends the Austrians, twenty-five killed and fifty-nine
wounded. Of the Bavarians were reckoned two
thousand five hundred killed and wounded, including
several officers.</p>

<p>The engagement had lasted till seven in the
evening. At nine the Bavarians retreated to Kufstein
under favour of the darkness. At four o'clock
the next morning, the victorious peasantry flocked
indiscriminately into Innsbruck, shouting and
singing, without any order, but yet without the least
offence in their demeanour or proceedings. At nine
o'clock Hofer marched in at the head of the men of
Passeyr; and with Father Joachim at his right hand.
By this time the city was full to overflowing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"You would have thought the very windows spake,<br />
So many greedy looks of young and old<br />
Through casements darted their desiring eyes<br />
Upon his visage;"<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="uni">&mdash;for, certainly, the impression prevailed among the
good people of Innsbruck that he was the great man
of the day, and so it continued to do.</p>

<p>Michael Stumff, beaming like the sun, stood on
the threshold of his house to catch a glimpse of the
Sandwirth as he passed, vaunting much his familiarity
with him to those who were willing to listen;
and extolling his valour because it enhanced the
honour of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he repeated, wagging his head,
"there's more in him than you'd think, for as homely
as he looks. Why now, Chastelar,&mdash;we've had
General Chastelar among us, though now, I'm sorry
to hear, he has quitted the country,&mdash;and Hormayr&mdash;we've
had Baron Hormayr among us too, of whose
doings or misdoings at this present occasion, I
suppose we shall shortly have his own account,&mdash;both
of these have been counted noteworthy men,&mdash;to
say nothing of our own Baron Taxis&mdash;but, to my
mind, there's not a greater man among 'em all, in
spite of his homely bearing, than my honest friend
the Sandwirth. Ah, here he comes!&mdash;nay, not yet&mdash;How
the bells are ringing! and yet there's such a
din, clang, and confusion, they scarce can be heard.
Here he comes, then!&mdash;yes, yes, the green jackets
walking six or eight abreast&mdash;there's <em>he</em>, look you,
neighbour!&mdash;there's my old ally the Sandwirth!&mdash;many
a pot of beer have he and I shared together!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
And now, see you, he has a feather in his hat, and a
sword at his side, and pistols in his belt. Hurra!
hurra! I say, Sandwirth!&mdash;(Nod at him, Alouise&mdash;I'll
catch his eye.) Hurra! hurra!&mdash;"</p>

<p>The churches received them. As many as could
enter them, crowded the aisles; the rest hung about
the doors. After victory and thanksgiving, naturally
came feasting. Wounded men were more slowly
brought into the city, and hospitably received; and
numbers of escaped Tyrolese prisoners came panting
back to their friends at intervals throughout the day.</p>

<p>The Bavarians had pretty well consumed the
edibles of Innsbruck, but the damage was being
repaired as fast as was possible by supplies from the
country. Every house had its table spread with
such things as came to hand, for the refreshment of
all comers. At the inns and public rooms, dances
were got up; and those who had fought overnight
might now be seen cutting tremendous capers and
taking wondrous leaps, with some fair partner of
equal agility. But, flirting? none; the Tyrolese
eminently cultivate decorum, and know how to be
merry and wise. If you choose your partner, it is
for the entire evening; and often proves to be your
partner for life.</p>

<p>Late in the evening Baron Hormayr arrived at the
Taxis Palace. His throat was very sore, and he was
very hoarse, and not a little vexed at having had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
share in the glory of the day. Flinging himself on a
sofa, he desired Hofer might be instantly sought,
found, and sent to him.</p>

<p>In due course, the Sandwirth presented himself.</p>

<p>"So here you are, Hofer!" cried the Baron,
feverishly shaking up the cushion under his head.</p>

<p>"Here we are, baron&mdash;in Innsbruck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye, I suppose you are all mightily pleased.
If I had not had the worst cold I ever had in my
life, I should have been up with you&mdash;(Just ring for
a tisane&mdash;) Regularly knocked up at Imst, my good
fellow&mdash;could only dictate my orders in a whisper;
and fretted to death at not being able to lead the
attack at Scharnitz. Well, and so&mdash;O, you've got
on Chastelar's sword and pistols, I see."</p>

<p>"The sword and pistols the general gave me,
baron."</p>

<p>"Aha! Made a good show! hey?"</p>

<p>"Helped to do good service, I hope."</p>

<p>"No doubt, no doubt. The people adore you,
Hofer! And yet you haven't been much of a
fighting man&mdash;what makes them like you so?&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>"I do not justly know, baron, save that they know
I love them. Love kindles love, you know."</p>

<p>"Aye, aye&mdash;well, but how went the day? Eisenstecken
and you, I suppose, helped Colonel Ertel in
winning the day?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, baron, Eisenstecken is a good lad, but I
should have said Father Joachim, Speckbacher, and
I won the day, helped by Colonel Ertel. But,
since it is won, it's no matter."</p>

<p>"Just so, you all did your best, my good
friend&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We were quite at a stand-still at one time, for
powder and bullets."</p>

<p>"Hofer! what a shocking want of ammunition
there has been throughout this campaign! General
Buol has been in a wretched state, without either
ammunition or money. There he has remained, on
the Brenner with twenty-three hundred men, and
actually not a cartridge!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our men were making cartridges all day long,
for three days before the battle. You know, baron,
the Tyrol has few resources in itself; we have few
powder-mills, and the frontiers are now so watched
that it is exceeding difficult to get any into the
country, even when we have any money to pay for
it, which generally we have not."</p>

<p>"No, and then you waste so much in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feux-de-joie</i>
and such nonsense, at every rustic wedding and
merry-making; every petty success. Why, I can
hear your sharpshooters peppering away now!"</p>

<p>"Because yesterday's was not a petty success.
Forgive them, baron. Every time we fight you a
Berg Isel, you may afford us a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i>. However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the lads are wasting their powder now, I
acknowledge; and, when I go hence, I will stop it."</p>

<p>"Do so; and&mdash;just give me that carafe of iced
water and the goblet; I'm so thirsty!&mdash;Have some
wine, Hofer?"</p>

<p>"No, baron, I thank you."</p>

<p>"Tell them, Hofer, for goodness' sake, to husband
what little ammunition they possess, for they
don't know how important it is."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, they do, baron! They knew, yesterday,
when their own was spent; and luckily, the Bavarians'
was exhausted too!"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>"Speckbacher has a little boy, who runs into the
thick of the fight, picks up bullets, and brings them
to his father to use again."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Cool!&mdash;Where's Speckbacher now?"</p>

<p>"At the heels of the Bavarians."</p>

<p>"Where's Major Teimer?"</p>

<p>"At the heels of Speckbacher."</p>

<p>"Ho!&mdash;Well, Hofer, you'll just speak to your
men&mdash;and to-morrow I'll put forth a proclamation&mdash;I'd
dictate it to-night, only my head aches ready
to split&mdash;telling every true Tyrolean, whose heart,
and so forth,&mdash;had better show his love of his
country by abstaining from feu-de-joieing, and by
hunting up, without delay, all such arms, rifles,
muskets, swords, cavalry saddles, and what not, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
can be found, and bringing them with all speed to
head-quarters. Bless my heart! what a number of
precious lives might be taken by the ammunition
these silly clodhoppers are now wasting!"</p>

<p>"I'll go to them at once, baron. And, if you'll
take my unworthy advice, you'll go to bed, and drink
something hot."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you,&mdash;I believe I shall, or
something cold, for I'm very feverish&mdash;you see one
eye is quite bunged up already. Good night. I'm
sorry you won't take a glass of wine, though. Let
me see you in the morning."</p>

<p>Hofer assented, with a gesture, and withdrew.
"Poor man! poor gentleman, I mean," thought he.
"He seems much afflicted at having a stuffing in the
head; almost as much as at not having won yesterday's
battle. Well, well! we must each do what we
can, we are but as God made us."</p>

<p>Here he was joined by Giuseppe Eisenstecken,
who had been drinking iced champagne, and seemed
very cheerful.</p>

<p>"<i>Sanvird</i>," said he, clapping his hand familiarly
on Hofer's shoulder, "what reward do you think
I have hit on for my work of yesterday?"</p>

<p>"What reward have I thought of for myself or
Speckbacher?" said Hofer. "Our success is reward
enough for us all, I think."</p>

<p>"Ah, basta! I have been a good adjutant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
you, <i>Sanvird</i>. Without me the day would not have
been won&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! I have yet to learn it."</p>

<p>"<i>Sanvird</i>, you have a daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Three."</p>

<p>"Ah! Two are children&mdash;your Theresa is ...
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">bella, bella veramente</i>!"</p>

<p>"I have not now to learn that," said Hofer,
laughing and shaking him off; "but you had better
think of something else, my lad&mdash;you and she have
nothing in common."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm aware I am not common," said Giuseppe,
"but any little advantage I may have of
birth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold, there, my boy. We Hofers have been
Sandwirths of repute for many generations. Good
night, now. I am very tired, and am going to bed;
and I advise you to do the same."</p>

<p>Eisenstecken stared, shrugged his shoulders, and
walked off to the theatre.</p>

<p>When the news of the victory of Berg Isel spread
through the valleys, which it did like wildfire, much
rejoicing and festivity ensued. The darling passion
of the mountaineers is for music and dancing.
Every cottage has its violin or guitar; and the
Tyrolese not only sing, but have a gift of improvising
verses, rough indeed, and with little pretension
to polish or harmony, but not destitute of wit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
satire, nor without occasional touches of pathos.
These accomplishments were brought into play at a
national festival given in honour of the victory of
Berg Isel. The chief merit attained or aimed at, is
a quickness at repartee; each party in the impromptu
dialogue striving to make the other ridiculous.
Sometimes when the cut is very unexpected,
the person assailed is bereft of presence of mind;
and his or her confusion affords abundant amusement
to the audience.</p>

<p>Theresa, Rudolf, and Franz were all good at this
pastime&mdash;Rudolf the best, because Theresa's bashfulness
often restrained her, and Franz's satire
scarcely ever rose to the value of wit. At the rustic
merry-making at <i>am Sand</i>, all three were present;
and Franz, nettled by Theresa's rejection of him,
assailed her with several such stinging impromptus,
that were no impromptus at all, having been prepared
beforehand, that Theresa turned the tables on
him, with a true woman's malice, for cowardice on
the day of battle, and invented such a number of
absurd reasons for his keeping out of harm's way,
that hearty laughter resounded on all sides; and
Franz, smarting more than he showed, secretly
resolved to have his day of revenge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the ground was clearing for wrestlers.
Almost every Tyrolese wears a thick silver or iron
ring on the little finger of the right hand, to use in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the pugilistic encounters they call <i>robeln</i>; and a fist
so armed can inflict cruel wounds. Franz, irritated
by Theresa's sarcasms, felt a burning desire to inflict
some disfiguring hurt on Rudolf; and, though rather
afraid of trying his strength with him, the evil desire
predominated, and he challenged him to a match.
But Rudolf happened to have no mind for it; and
as soon as Franz clearly made out this, he never
ceased pestering Rudolf, and twitting him with his
backwardness, till Rudolf, at length losing patience,
told him that if he did not desist, he would pitch
him into the Passeyr.</p>

<p>Such a wicked expression came into Franz's face,
on this, that it made Theresa's blood run cold; and
she hastily interrupted the strife by exclaiming, "The
miracle-play is just going to begin. Franz, are not
you to be the Philistine?"</p>

<p>The subject was David and Goliath. Rudolf was
David, and Franz (on stilts) Goliath. The subordinate
parts were filled by other peasants. Rudolf
came in, driving a real donkey, supposed to be laden
with the ten cheeses for his brethren's captain; and
he questioned about the fight, and answered his
brother's rebuke very effectively. Franz mouthed
the defiance to Israel extremely well, and straddled
and swaggered about like a very Goliath. The
Passeyr was very handy to represent the brook that
supplied the pebbles; and Rudolf, though he slung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the stone near enough to his antagonist to make
Franz swerve his head considerably to one side, was
at pains not really to hit him. Franz did not know
this, however; he thought the pebble was slung
unreasonably and maliciously close; therefore, when
Rudolf ran up to his prostrate body to make believe
to sever his head with the Sandwirth's own sword,
Franz hooked his foot round his rival's ankle, and
suddenly brought him with violence to the ground.
This was so unexpected a catastrophe, that a cry,
mingled with laughter, arose from the audience.
But Rudolf was not to be so baffled; he clasped his
arms strictly round his foe, who already was under
him, and writhing, struggling, and rolling, they
twisted one another about till Rudolf finally got his
antagonist to the water's edge, and soused him in
the Passeyr. Whereupon there naturally ensued
a clamour of laughter and applause; and the victor
was tumultuously greeted; while the drenched giant
slunk moodily out of sight.</p>

<p>Rudolf now triumphantly mounted the stilts, and
strode round the green; but Hofer, who had played
King Saul, and who liked a joke as well as any one,
aimed a large turnip so well at the right stilt, that
Rudolf was suddenly laid prostrate. As his encumbrances
effectually prevented his rising, (the ends
being seized by several little boys, and big ones too,)
he lay quite at the mercy of the public, especially of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Theresa, who sang a requiem over him, much in the
style of "Who killed cock robin?"</p>

<div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
Who killed poor David?<br />
Can this be he who late was seen<br />
The pride of every village-green?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Alas, poor David!</span><br />
        </div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
Who fetched him down?<br />
On lordly stilts we saw him stride<br />
A season brief, too swollen with pride&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Alas, poor David!</span><br />
        </div>
</div>
<div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
Take warning, all with pride elate,<br />
Behold this hapless youngster's fate;<br />
A turnip vile has cracked his pate.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Alas, poor David!</span><br />
        </div>
</div>
<p>It was remarked that as soon as Theresa began to
sing, the prostrate victim lay quite still; and as soon
as she ceased, he declared in a loud voice that since
he was dead, he was determined to be buried.
"Four proper youths and tall" immediately stepped
forward, and raised him, stiff as a log, on their
shoulders, then bore him with decent solemnity to
the dust heap.</p>

<p>After this deportation, Rudolf seemed to think
himself exonerated from further communication with
any of his fellow-mortals, except Theresa, with whom
he was seen, by those who thought it worth while to
look after him, in earnest conversation at the dairy-door.</p>

TROUBLED WATERS.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">F</span>OUR men, two of whom wore the brown serge
gowns of Capuchins, might have been seen, on
the fourth of June, sitting on the bank of a foaming
river, and presently rising in stilts from the pebbly
bed of the river itself, sounding their way in advance,
as they crossed it, by the aid of long poles.
These were Hofer, Eisenstecken, Father Joachim,
and Father Peter, on their way to Rattenberg, where
they were to meet Hormayr, Baron Taxis, the engineer
Hauser, and the chiefs of the lower Innthal.
At this time, the Inn was so swollen by recent and
heavy rains, as to be both difficult and dangerous to
cross; but the bridges had all been destroyed during
the warfare, and our friends had only this hazardous
mode of fording the river.</p>

<p>"I'm going!" cried Father Peter, in alarm, as
the running water, flashing in the sun, dazzled his
eye.</p>

<p>"Why, brother, didst never walk on stilts before?"
cried Father Joachim, catching him by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
arm, and heartily laughing. "Shame on you for
a faint heart. Steady, steady. Don't upset <em>me</em>,
though, good brother."</p>

<p>"Or I may chance to get a rap on the head with
that staff," muttered Father Peter. "There! I'm
out of the perilous waters at last,&mdash;the most dangerous
voyage I ever undertook."</p>

<p>Saying which, he scrambled out on the other
bank, giving a lurch, however, as he did so, which
entangled his stilt in one of Father Joachim's, and
nearly gave him a ducking. The excellent Capuchin
turned exceedingly red, but suppressed his wrath, if
he felt any, merely observing, "Thou deservest a
crack on the pate most assuredly, good brother!"</p>

<p>Then, having burst into a jolly laugh, that made
the hills ring again, he suddenly stopped short, wiped
his eyes, and went on, silent as night; till at length
he said to Hofer&mdash;</p>

<p>"A laugh is worth a zwanziger now and then.
Or else, it makes my heart sore to pass along this
valley, only a few weeks ago in the highest possible
state of cultivation, and diversified with villages in
the neatest order; now presenting on every side
a spectacle of ruin and desolation."</p>

<p>"<i>Eheu</i>," sighed Father Peter, in response, "'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Incenderunt
igni sanctuarium tuum; in terra polluerunt
nominis tui.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, brother," rejoined Father Joachim,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
"<i>'Lætabitur justus in Domino, et sperabit in eo, ut laudabuntur
omnes recti corde;</i>' which, if we interpret
for the benefit of the unlearned, is as much as to
say, the righteous shall, notwithstanding, rejoice in
the Lord and put their trust in Him; and all they
that are true of heart shall be glad."</p>

<p>"The Bavarians may trust in their chariots and
horses," said Hofer, "but we will trust in the Lord
our God."</p>

<p>"Ah, I wish we had some more horses, though,"
broke in Eisenstecken, "for we are miserably deficient
in cavalry."</p>

<p>"What on earth should we do with cavalry?"
cried Father Joachim. "Why, our very want of it
makes us respected the more, because our successes
can only be attributed to our natural intrepidity and
resolution."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, father; our successes can only last
among the hills, we cannot compete with the enemy
in the plains."</p>

<p>"Never mind that," interposed Father Peter,
setting aside an objection that could not be answered.
"Let them keep their plains to themselves, as long
as we have our hills."</p>

<p>While talking in this desultory fashion, they came
up with one of those rustic processions so common
in the mountains, when the cows, having exhausted
the pastures in the valleys, are driven up the hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
for the summer. The tinkling of bells, and rustic
sounds of music which accompanied it, could be
heard far off. First came the <i>senner</i>, or milker, at
the head of the cows, with ribbons of many colours
bedecking his hat and shoes, and a long staff in his
hand, with which he gesticulated in a theatrical
manner. Immediately after him marched the principal
cow of a herd amounting to some hundreds,
belonging to different farmers; her head and neck
were decorated with immense garlands of the gayest
flowers, interspersed with knots and streamers, pink,
blue, and yellow, and bearing a deep-toned bell suspended
by an embroidered strap. The other cows
succeeded, each adorned with smaller bells, streamers,
and garlands, and quite aware of their subordinate
dignity. Then came the <i>galleter</i>, driving the heifers
and calves, and having in his charge the fetters and
halters of the whole herd. Then followed the goat-keeper,
with a long train of goats; then the <i>schäfer</i>,
or shepherd, with his numerous flocks of sheep; and
lastly, the <i>sandirne</i>, or pig-driver, with his unruly herd.</p>

<p>When the <i>senner</i> in advance of this procession
came near enough to be recognised, he proved to be
Franz, who was a good herdsman enough, and being
never very fond of either smuggling or fighting when
they threatened much danger, was very glad to get
a safe, and, in the eyes of mountaineers, honourable,
employment for the rest of the summer. He enjoyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the pomp and circumstance of the procession
amazingly, and hardly less so the prospect of occasional
long, lonely hours of luxurious idleness which
were sure to follow, when lying at full length on
thymy banks watching his charge.</p>

<p>Lenora had trimmed his hat and shoes with the
greatest taste, helped him to furbish up the bells,
and provided him with many little comforts. As
soon as he saw he was recognised by acquaintance,
his self-importance increased ten-fold. He attitudinized,
strutted, and flourished his staff, till he
made, as Giuseppe contemptuously observed, quite
an ape of himself. Hofer, pitying him more than
he deserved for the inglorious life he was going to
lead, spoke a few kind words to him, and the priests
gave him their blessings.</p>

<p>There is, or was, a good old inn, in the quaint
little old-fashioned town of Rattenberg. In the
best room of this inn, the three barons were already
awaiting the Tyrolese, and chafing a little at their
not having arrived first.</p>

<p>"Here they come at last," muttered Baron
Hauser; "four of them, and we have only ordered
covers for six."</p>

<p>"Who is the fourth?" said Baron Hormayr,
looking up from his papers; "Teimer, perhaps."</p>

<p>"No; two Capuchins, Hofer, and a tall, swarthy
youth&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Eisenstecken&mdash;I forgot the second Capuchin&mdash;he
may be of use, but he is not equal to Father
Joachim. Well, Hofer, here at last, man!"</p>

<p>"The Inn was turbid, baron, and the bridges
broken."</p>

<p>"Ha! how did you ford it?"</p>

<p>"On stilts."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! that made you late, I suppose."</p>

<p>"And wet, too," said Father Joachim, shaking
his gown.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Capuchins on stilts! The idea is
amusing."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say to that," said Father
Peter bluntly, "unless you find amusement in the
discomfort of your fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>"Pardon, good father. Hungry men are apt to
be captious, and I feared our fish would be spoilt;
here it comes,&mdash;let us hope for the best."</p>

<p>Father Joachim said grace, and they fed like
hungry men as much as heroes. After the dishes
were removed, which was not in less than an hour,
they began to talk of business.</p>

<p>"We want a map," said Baron Taxis; "Hauser,
have you one?"</p>

<p>Hauser produced a map, but it was too small,
and proved to be incorrect. Hofer eyed it with
contempt.</p>

<p>"I can draw a better map than that," said he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
dipping his finger in his glass, and making various
small slops on the table. "This is Hobranz, and
this is Kempten; here are our men of the Vorarlberg,
and here the Bavarians."</p>

<p>"You have made Kempten too large in proportion
to Hobranz," said Baron Hauser, superciliously.</p>

<p>"The position is the question, not the size," said
Hofer; which was so undeniably the case, that the
baron did not reply to it.</p>

<p>"Well then, here is Fuessen," said Hormayr.
"The men of Vorarlberg must try to effect a
junction with Teimer somewhere hereabouts; and
Major Dietrich, advancing by Ettal, will assist the
communication; while you, Taxis, will advance
towards Clagenfurt; and Leinengen towards Trent.
We shall muster little short of thirty thousand
men, regulars and Tyrolese; and if this movement
succeeds, my judgment is, that it will lead to the
entire liberation of the Tyrol."</p>

<p>The discussion lasted long; and the council broke
up, animated with sanguine hopes of success. In
a few days the scheme was attempted. Unfortunately,
Martin Teimer, by some mistake, overshot
his mark, and being ignorant of the country, strayed
away from the men of Vorarlberg, and fell in with
a detachment of the enemy, by whom he was nearly
made prisoner. Meanwhile, the Vorarlbergers,
whose eagerness had made them begin the fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
early in the day, were disappointed of Teimer's expected
support; and only owing to their great
intrepidity and coolness, were able to retire in good
order: which was all they had to console them
for not winning a brilliant victory. Count Leinengen
was threatened with bombardment in Trent, and
Hormayr and Hofer were hastening to his relief,
when they learnt that the enemy had retired. A few
subsequent skirmishes in the mountains had no
result of importance.</p>

<p>Suddenly the news reached the combatants of the
decisive battle of Wagram, one of the most brilliant
fields ever won by Buonaparte, and disastrous in its
effects on the Austrian cause. All further resistance
being abandoned by the vanquished, they were glad
to conclude the armistice of Znaim, by which they
agreed to evacuate the Tyrol.</p>

<p>Words cannot describe the trouble and indignation
of the Tyrolese, when this news, which they at first
refused to believe, was fully confirmed. Eisenstecken,
and a party of his companions in arms,
rushed into the little cottage which gave Hofer
temporary shelter, and passionately implored him to
be their chief, and prevent the Austrian troops from
leaving the country.</p>

<p>With mild and pacifying words he assured them
how wrong and fruitless this would be. They then
besought him at least forcibly to detain the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
ammunition, and attempt the liberation of their
country without the assistance of those who were
deserting them.</p>

<p>Hofer demurred about the ammunition, but
declared himself ready to obey the call of his countrymen,
and appointed a time and place for deciding
on what should be done. His listeners heard him
joyfully, and hastened away to spread the glad
tidings; Eisenstecken not hesitating to attempt to
draw off from their allegiance as many of the
Austrian privates as he could.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hofer, summoned by Hormayr to
resign his command, required twelve hours for deliberation.
Part of this interval was spent in grave
and sorrowful consultation with his fellow chiefs,
and much of it in deep and fervent prayer.</p>

<p>At the end of the time, "We have fought for the
rights of Austria," said he&mdash;"we will now fight for
our own."</p>

<p>This decision was hailed by the Tyrolese with
transport. Attachment and loyalty to the house of
Austria had ever been their prominent characteristics;
they had been incited to rise by the Emperor
himself, and had fought for him faithfully and well.
Deserted by him, their independence was now at
stake; and while despotism crushed the liberties of
nearly all Europe, this handful of heroic mountaineers
resolved to free themselves or perish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tyrolese flocked to Hofer's standard the
instant it was raised; the Austrian troops in the
Vorarlberg deserted their leaders and enthusiastically
joined the insurgents. Many of the Austrian
troops who had begun to march homewards, were
persuaded by the Tyrolese to turn back. Nearly
the whole of Taxis's corps deserted him, and quietly
marched to Hofer, deaf to threats and entreaties.
Hofer, who had declared himself willing to fight
under Leinengen as a simple soldier if his countrymen
preferred it, found himself unanimously elected
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>Poor Baron Hormayr was in a pitiable state of
mind; annoyed beyond measure at the armistice,
yet with every feeling of a disciplinarian outraged
by the extremely irregular conduct of the Tyrolese
and the insubordination of his own troops. Looking
upon Hofer and Speckbacher as the magicians by
whom alone the storm could be quelled, he sent for
the former, and earnestly, importunately besought
him to think well of what he was about before he
refused to lay down his arms.</p>

<p>But Hofer was immoveable. He had deliberated
in great trouble on what was right and necessary;
and having besought divine direction, his conviction
was now unshaken as to the duty of maintaining
the cause, whether successfully or not. In his previous
summons to Hormayr, he had been taken by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
surprise, had been very irresolute, had shifted from
foot to foot, played with his pistols and sword,
spoken absently, and betrayed all the marks of
vacillation. He had had time to ponder and to
pray; and now Hormayr might as well have tried
to move Mount Brenner.</p>

<p>As for Father Joachim, he had gone off, in a fit of
desperation, to his convent at Brixen, where he
shut himself up in his cell, rolled on the ground,
smote himself on the breast, and tore handfuls out
of his bushy red beard.</p>

THE GORGE OF THE EISACH.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Baron, vexed and provoked, next tried his
rhetoric upon Speckbacher. Now, Speckbacher
was like the Passeyr in a high wind up-current,
"driven to and fro, and tost." He had of
late been very unprofitably spending his time in
endeavouring to reduce the strong fortress of
Kufstein, and was a good deal humbled at finding
it too hard a nut for him to crack. Therefore,
when Baron Hormayr, with all his force of elocution,
painted the hopelessness of the Tyrolese cause, and
the certainty of their making things considerably
worse for themselves if they were vanquished&mdash;Speckbacher
lost his spirits and became convinced
that the case was desperate. Hormayr, seeing his
advantage, then hinted on Speckbacher's being
particularly and personally obnoxious to the Bavarians
as a formidable insurgent chief, observed on the
desirableness of a temporary withdrawal from public
notice, and finally offered him a seat in his own
carriage if he would accompany him into Austria.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Eisenstecken was on his way thither already. Speckbacher's
heart hovered over his cottage among the
beech-trees; but he was desponding and irresolute;
a few coaxing words settled the matter&mdash;he would
but make a hasty visit to his home and return, if
the Baron would be so kind as to wait for him.</p>

<p>The Baron would do so by all means, but hoped
he would be quick; so off sped Speckbacher at a
swinging pace, but with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>Arrived at his cottage, what should he see but his
little boy at the threshold, intently watching the
farm-servant, Zoppel, making him a toy rifle.
Directly he looked up and saw his father, he joyfully
cried out, ran towards him, and clasped his
knees; then seizing him by the hand, dragged him
towards the house, capering as he went.</p>

<p>Maria, meantime, had come to the door with a
child in her arms and another holding her apron.</p>

<p>"Home at last," said she with fond reproach.</p>

<p>"Home; soon to depart again," said Speckbacher,
entering the house.</p>

<p>"No doubt," said she, pouting a little, as she
gave him the baby to kiss; "that's what we must
expect as long as the war goes on; however, you
know, we talked that all over and counted up the
cost at the beginning, and decided not to mind it."</p>

<p>"We did," said Speckbacher in a melancholy
tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you must not mind," pursued Maria
cheerily, "if I do give you a grumpy word or a
pouting look now and then, because it is over in a
moment; for I assure you, I remember all you said
to me too well to think seriously of minding it at
any time."</p>

<p>"But, Maria! Don't you know there has been
an armistice proclaimed?"</p>

<p>"Between whom?"</p>

<p>"The French, Bavarians, and Austrians."</p>

<p>"To be sure I do," said she with curling lip;
"but what have <em>we</em> to do with that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a question!" groaned Speckbacher.</p>

<p>"It hardly amounts to one, I think," said Maria.
"Why, have not all the Austrian soldiery deserted
to us, and is not the Sandwirth Commander-in-Chief?"</p>

<p>"My dearest Maria, Baron Hormayr has been
using all his influence with us both to forbear from
shedding blood in a hopeless case. And he has
promised to take me with him in his own carriage
to Vienna to be out of the way a little, till the affair
has blown over.</p>

<p>"What, and give up the cause?" cried Maria in
blank dismay.</p>

<p>Her look smote her husband to the heart.</p>

<p>"Then you don't approve of it?" said he, inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, <em>do you</em>?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know&mdash;Eisenstecken has given it
up for one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Maria dropped the baby into the little wooden
cradle on the dresser, and began to furbish a brass
skillet very vigorously.</p>

<p>&mdash;"But, if you don't," faltered he, "neither shall
I; for, if my life is worth nothing to <em>you</em>, to me it
is not of the value of a kreutzer."</p>

<p>"O Speckbacher!" cried she, suddenly flinging
her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>"Well, what now?" said he; his eyes beginning
to grow misty.</p>

<p>"How <em>can</em> you say such things?" sobbed Maria.
"Not worth a kreutzer, indeed! You, the best
Tyrolese that lives!&mdash;the father of a family&mdash;a
married man&mdash;a responsible person&mdash;known and
beloved by all&mdash;to talk of not being worth a
kreutzer!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Anderl increased the effect by beginning to
weep aloud, and with perseverance.</p>

<p>"Well," said Speckbacher, in a stifled voice, and
drawing her very close to him, "you seemed to
think I was deserting the cause&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, only&mdash;no&mdash;that is&mdash;If Baron Hormayr
says right,&mdash;and he ought to know,&mdash;why, the cause
is deserting <em>you</em>, not you it&mdash;at least&mdash;Ah, it is not
so! O Speckbacher, I am pulled two ways! why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
have you made me think the cause so important all
along, if you are going to forsake it now?"</p>

<p>"Why, so it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then, why desert it?"</p>

<p>"Because, dear, they say it's hopeless. I wish
you would not use that uncomfortable word
'desert.'"</p>

<p>"I will not&mdash;I feel persuaded that a brave man
may forsake a hopeless cause&mdash;nay, I think he owes
it to those who love him. What sleepless nights
have you given me, Speckbacher! But now, if I
think you are safe, my rest will be sweet."</p>

<p>"I declare I know not what to do," cried Speckbacher,
tossing his arms upwards, and then starting
up and pacing the room in an agitated manner,&mdash;then,
throwing himself into a seat,&mdash;"I'll be guided
by you."</p>

<p>"Then go with the Baron," said Maria, after
a moment's pause&mdash;"yours is too precious a life to
be thrown away. When I felt it useless to remonstrate,
and my mind was convinced besides, I wound
myself up to a sort of false composure; but now,
that has all dissolved away; the necessity for it is
gone, and I can only see you, hear you, think of
you as the dearest of husbands, the best and tenderest
of men."</p>

<p>Speckbacher wept. But his wife was firm. She
packed up a little supply of linen for him, bade him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
remember the Baron was waiting, kissed him cheerfully,
and watched him till he was out of sight.
Speckbacher trod much more heavily on his way
back than when he came. Dejected, solitary, slow,
dragging a lengthening chain as he went, he tardily
returned to the Baron, who was getting fidgety.</p>

<p>"Your adieux took you a long time," said he,
rather peevishly.</p>

<p>Speckbacher made no reply, but silently followed
him into the carriage, and they drove off towards
Sterzing.</p>

<p>Baron Hormayr felt it would not do to neglect
his companion; and, being a man of considerable
information and address, he began an agreeable conversation
with two aides-de-camp, who were of the
party, relating several anecdotes likely to interest
Speckbacher, and beguile the way. Nothing could
win from the dispirited Tyrolese, however, more
than a divided attention. He assented absently to
questions that were put to him, sometimes quite at
cross purposes; and so clearly betrayed his dejection,
that Hormayr at length ceased to waste his time on
him, and entered into discussions exclusively interesting
to himself and the aides-de-camp.</p>

<p>The road was at this time winding up a steep hill,
and proceeded very slowly; being choked with
stones and brambles that had been cast across it
during the recent contest. Every inch of ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
had been a scene of struggle; to Speckbacher it was
mournfully suggestive. Suddenly there appeared
on a rocky path immediately above the road, a man
in green with a red waistcoat, who gave a gesture
of surprise when he saw them. It was Hofer.</p>

<p>Stretching out his arms to Speckbacher, he cried
in heart-rending tones, while tears fast coursed his
cheeks,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! my friend! my comrade! my brother!
whither are you going? they are carrying you to
ignominy! Return, ere it is yet too late! Return,
my friend! my brother!"</p>

<p>"Drive on!" cried Baron Hormayr passionately
to his coachman, while Speckbacher buried his face
in his hands. But, close his eyes as he would, he
still saw the gestures, and heard the plaintive tones
of the man on the rock.</p>

<p>His resolution was taken.</p>

<p>On reaching Sterzing, where some trifling delay
occurred, he slipped away from his companions, and,
procuring a horse, rode at full speed after Hofer,
while the Baron and his party waited for him in vain.
After a fruitless search, Hormayr perceived himself
outwitted, and pursued his journey in no very good
temper; though, being on the whole a kindly disposed
man, he soon ceased to be annoyed, and even
made a joke of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Speckbacher, spurring along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
mountain road, came up with Hofer on the Brenner,
and hastily threw himself off his horse, leading it
towards him. Hofer, hearing his approach, turned
about, and seeing who it was, paused, stretching
out his arms to him. When they met, they mutely
embraced.</p>

<p>"Escaped! Thank God!" said Hofer.</p>

<p>"Thank God," said Speckbacher, "I feel I've
done right."</p>

<p>"Rely on it. The wonder to me, brother, is,
that you could ever have been over-persuaded.
What! is our love of our country a mere dream?
How many have already laid down their lives for it!
For my part, I can die for freedom, but I cannot
live a slave. Will Austria, think you, be angry in
her heart, that we continue the defence of the
cause? On the contrary, she will secretly rejoice in
every success. Are you not certified of it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Every nation in Europe but one will rejoice
in it. The English will sympathize with us, so will
the Swiss, so will the Italians, so will the Northern
nations. They will sympathize with us in our
success, because we deserve it&mdash;and, should we
prove unfortunate, they will sympathize with us all
the more!"</p>

<p>"Hofer, go on talking&mdash;"</p>

<p>"First, let us pray, brother. Oh, how much we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
have to pray for! First, our country,&mdash;that our
poor, dear Tyrol may be delivered from all her
enemies; then for our emperor,&mdash;that he may look
kindly on us; and surely for our beloved Archduke
John, whose heart is ever with us. Then for ourselves.
Oh, we have much need to ask for direction,&mdash;we
are poor, unskilled men, pitted against the
cleverest man in the world; and how can we hold
our ground without supreme aid? Then for our
wives, children, and homes. See how much there is
for which to pray."</p>

<p>Speckbacher reverently uncovered his head, and
knelt. It was not the first time they had thus sought
heavenly guidance together. They arose strengthened,
calmed, and resolved.</p>

<p>On the second of August Father Joachim issued
forth from his cell. He heard that Lefevre, Duke of
Dantzic, had seized Innsbruck, and had boasted that
the Capuchin's red beard should get well pulled; on
which he grimly observed, "The Redbeard may be
too strong for him yet." From that hour Father
Joachim was known as "The Redbeard."</p>

<p>He met, by appointment, Hofer, Speckbacher,
and their three worthy weapon-brothers, Martin
Schenk, Peter Kemmater, and Peter Mayer. These
men had all pledged themselves to free the Tyrol, or
perish. Peter Mayer was he, who being afterwards
shot by order of Beauharnois at Botzen, removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a small crucifix from his heart, and handed it to a
bystander, as the soldiers were preparing to fire,
"lest," as he quietly observed, "it should turn the
shot."</p>

<p>Hofer's indecision was gone. "I have received
an invitation," said he, gaily, "from the Duke of
Dantzic, to deliver myself up to him before the 11th.
I have sent him word he may expect me, with ten
thousand sharpshooters."</p>

<p>It was decided that Father Joachim should open
the campaign. The general rising took place on the
fourth of August,&mdash;a day to be much remembered.</p>

<p>The post to be contested was a bridge across the
Eisach, which the enemy were resolved to pass, and
the Tyrolese were resolved they should not. Father
Joachim had prepared a tremendous barrier to their
doing so. He had caused enormous larch-trees to
be felled, on which were piled huge masses of rock,
and heaps of brushwood and stones, the whole being
held together by strong cords, and thus suspended
over the precipice.</p>

<p>At one end of this fearful avalanche he stationed
Rudolf, knife in hand, ready to cut the ropes the
moment he received instructions from a comrade
named Heisel, who commanded a view of the scene
of action far below.</p>

<p>When the enemy began to enter the pass, they
found themselves only opposed by small bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Tyrolese, who continued to fall back after desperate
but short attacks; and they began to think that
though many warnings had been given them of the
danger of this pass, they should find its difficulties
exaggerated, and clear it without much loss.</p>

<p>Suddenly an old man, at least eighty years of age,
with hair as white as snow, but with the fire of
youth in his dark eyes, levelled his piece from behind
an almost inaccessible crag, brought down his man,
reloaded his piece, and continued his deadly fire,
never wasting a bullet, yet without receiving the least
hurt in return. His execution was so fatal, that
a couple of Saxons were detached, and privately sent
round by a circuitous path to seize him. As soon
as they rushed upon him, he shouted "Hurra!"
shot the first, seized the second in his arms, and,
crying "In God's name!" precipitated himself with
him into the abyss below. The combatants looked
on for a moment aghast.</p>

<p>The next instant, however, the word "Forward"
was given in a voice of thunder, and the invaders
impetuously advanced, eager to get out of this
dreadful place. But there seemed to be fighting, or
some other obstacle, in front; the van did not advance,
and the body of troops, jammed together
between those who came on from behind, and those
who did not or could not proceed in front, came to
a stand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything was so still at this awful moment, that
a crow could be heard cawing in the air, high aloft.
This dread pause was broken by a clear voice far up
above, but immediately over them, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Heisel! shall I cut yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied another voice, that came wildly
through the air.</p>

<p>The Saxons, who heard these ill-omened words,
were occupying a little basin, about two hundred and
fifty paces across, hemmed in by rocks, except where
the narrow road crossed a bridge. The day was
intensely hot, and they were almost stifling. Suddenly
they beheld flames in advance; the covered
bridge had been set on fire!</p>

<p>"Shall I? Shall I?" cried the eager voice.</p>

<p>"Now then!" shouted the other. "In the name
of the holy Trinity!"</p>

<p>"Forward!" almost shrieked the officer in command;
but it was in vain.</p>

<p>"<em>Heisel, cut loose!</em>" A few quick ringing strokes
of an axe were followed by a thundering crash, as
though the very hills were giving way, and down
rushed rocks, trees, and masses of earth, darkening
the air, and the next instant burying the affrighted
Saxons in heaps, or sweeping them down into the
river.</p>

<p>Cries of agony and wild despair echoed the next
instant through the defile, mingled with hoarse shouts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and the tramp of cavalry. A trooper dashed madly
along the bridge; but before he could gallop over it,
the burning beams gave way under him, and he was
swept with them down the river. Some of the
Saxons attempted to force a passage; others to
ascend the rocks; but, weakened in numbers, and
daunted by the formidable nature of the warfare,
they finally gave way and retreated up the valley of
the Eisach, while the Tyrolese harassed them with
scattered shots, and finally retired to Brixen.</p>

THE THIRD VICTORY OF BERG ISEL.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE numbers of the peasantry accumulated during
the night. Hofer and Speckbacher were
on the Jauffen, and thousands flocked to their standard.
The rage of the Duke of Dantzic, when he
heard of the defeat of the Saxons in the gorge of
the Eisach, was extreme. He refused to believe the
road impassable, and sent Count Arco in a carriage,
with only two outriders, to install himself governor
of Brixen. The count came back more quickly than
he went. The duke, foaming with rage, set out on
the foolish journey himself; declaring he would date
his despatches "Botzen" before he was a league
out of Innsbruck. "Better wait till we are there,"
suggested one of his officers.</p>

<p>He told the innkeeper's wife at Sterzing that "he
was going to chew up the cursed peasants;" but he
did not get as far as the Saxons had done. The
rear of his detachment was attacked by a body of
Tyrolese with great fury, and completely routed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
they tore the dragoons from their horses, and killed
them with the butt-ends of their muskets. The
whole division dispersed; and the duke made the
best of his way to Innsbruck, which he ignominiously
entered, disguised as a common trooper. And thus
his hopes of chewing up the peasantry were, for the
season, defeated.</p>

<p>Seventeen hundred Bavarians, advancing from
Landeck towards Prutz, with the design of falling on
the rear of Hofer's troops near Sterzing, were intercepted
by a body of Tyrolese, who, after an obstinate
fight of several hours, compelled them to retreat
with great loss. At break of day the peasants recommenced
their fire; but, finding the Bavarians would
not answer it, a pause of several hours ensued, at
the end of which the Tyrolese, impatient of inaction,
mustered to the number of about three hundred,
armed with pitchforks, pikes, and scythes; and
shouting loudly, precipitated themselves towards the
enemy.</p>

<p>The Bavarians, terrified at such formidable and
unusual weapons of war, instantly hoisted a white
flag, and unconditionally surrendered. About nine
hundred men and two hundred horses thus fell into
the hands of these three hundred Tyrolese, the rest
having fallen or escaped. Of the peasants, only
seven were killed and four wounded. Perhaps it
was on this occasion that they drove their prisoners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
into a large cavern, threatening to shoot those who
endeavoured to escape.</p>

<p>Thus, without the help of the Austrians, the
Tyrolese were successful in almost every encounter
with their enemies; and these successes inspired
them with the most confident hopes of effecting the
liberation of their country.</p>

<p>And now the Tyrolese drew together to fight their
third victorious battle of Berg Isel. Their numbers
amounted, at the utmost, to eighteen thousand, including
about three hundred Austrian volunteers;
while the Duke of Dantzic found himself at the
head of twenty-five thousand disciplined troops,
with forty pieces of artillery. But his men were
unwilling to fight; the Tyrolese were burning to
begin.</p>

<p>Hofer commanded in person, and took up his
quarters, as he had done in May, at the little inn of
"the Spade," at Schönberg; where the bed on
which he slept is shown with fond reverence to this
day. The right wing was commanded by Speckbacher,
under whom the brave Count Mohr led on
the peasants of the Vintsghan.</p>

<p>Father Joachim came up with the main body
during the night; and, learning where Hofer was,
immediately repaired to him.</p>

<p>The tired Sandwirth was soundly sleeping when a
vigorous hand shook him by the arm, and he started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
up, looking a little bewildered, till he recognised the
Capuchin.</p>

<p>"Is it break of day, father?" said he, rubbing his
eyes. "I'm ready."</p>

<p>"Arise, and follow me," said Father Joachim
briefly.</p>

<p>Hofer, in some surprise, rose, hastily dressed, girt
on his sword, and mutely obeyed. The Capuchin
went out into the open air, looked up a moment at
the stars, and then strode forward without speaking
a word. After a time, they found themselves in
a little country churchyard, with garlands, crosses,
and little vessels of holy water over many a rustic
grave. The Capuchin walked on towards a large
crucifix; and then pausing and addressing his
companion, said in a low voice, "Let us pray; but
not too loudly, for we are close to the Austrian
lines."</p>

<p>The next moment they were murmuring&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
Christ, have mercy upon us.<br />
Lord, have mercy upon us.<br />
</div>

<p>Then Father Joachim poured out his soul in
prayer and supplication&mdash;in Latin? Oh no!&mdash;There
are emergencies when the stanchest Roman Catholic
must, if he pray at all, make his petitions in
the words that come first. Father Joachim's were
strong and simple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The action commenced at six o'clock the next
morning, August the 12th.</p>

<p>The plan of attack very much resembled that of
the 29th of May.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"The good old plan,</span><br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
And they should keep who can;"<br />
</div>

<p class="uni">&mdash;in other words, that the Bavarians should take
Berg Isel if they could dislodge the Tyrolese, and
that the Tyrolese should not only keep their own,
but drive their enemies completely off the field and
make themselves masters of the bridges and approaches
to Innsbruck.</p>

<p>No capital blunder seems to have been committed
on either side. For several hours, the struggle
raged with fury. The bridge of the Sill was contested
with great bravery by both sides; but at
length the Bavarians gave way, and were to be seen
flying in every direction. The Tyrolese only had
fifty killed and a hundred and thirty-two wounded.
The Bavarians estimated their own loss at five
thousand; and seventeen hundred wounded fell
into the hands of their victors. In a few days the
enemy had quitted the country, committing every
excess as they retreated.</p>

<p>On the 15th of August, Hofer, having a third time
delivered his country, made his triumphal entry into
Innsbruck. His wife and children were in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
balcony to watch his entry. The old streets echoed
with the continuous tramp of thousands of feet, and
the merry peals of church bells were drowned in the
shouts. He looked grave, not elated, and directed
his steps, as before, to the Imperial Church; where,
just before he crossed the threshold, the multitude
renewed their acclamations. He lifted up his hand
and finger in admonitory action.</p>

<p>"Hist! Now, prayer; not shouting.&mdash;One
above&mdash;"</p>

<p>These simple words were heard by all. After the
service, he proceeded to the Imperial Palace, which
thenceforth became his home while he remained in
Innsbruck. Here, his family, terrified and elated,
clustered round him. He embraced them with
emotion, then quitted them and went out on the
balcony, to address the crowd below. And thus,
in simple phrase, he spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, God salute you all, my beloved Innsbruckers!
Because you would have me, whether
or no, your Obercommandant, so am I bound to
you. But there are some here who are no Innsbruckers.
All that will be my weapon-brothers,
must be ready to fight for God, for our emperor,
and our fatherland, like brave and honest Tyrolese.
Those who will not do that, should rather go directly
home. My real weapon-brothers will not forsake
me; neither will I forsake you, so true as I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
called Andreas Hofer. Now I have spoken to you&mdash;you
have spoken to me: so God preserve you all."</p>

<p>For the multitude, according to their wont, were
so fond of hearing their own sweet voices, that even
these few sentences had been frequently interrupted
by&mdash;</p>

<p>"Save you, Hofer! Hurrah!&mdash;We're all true
weapon-brothers. And those that are not shall be
ducked in the Inn. Long live the Emperor. Hofer
for ever. Hurrah!"</p>

<p>The Sandwirth kept his family with him only
forty-eight hours. He had a very great dread of the
allurements of what, to him, appeared a very
luxurious capital. So Anna and Theresa, having
strayed about the city with the children, visited
the Hoffkirche, the market, and the public walks,
and enjoyed the female privilege of a little shopping,
contentedly retraced their way home on mules; for
there are none but mule-paths to the Passeyrthal.</p>

<p>And now, certain barons, counts, and colonels in
the Austrian service, who had seen a little of Hofer
during the late campaign, amused themselves greatly
by what they termed his "ridiculous" assumption
in taking up his quarters in the imperial palace;
and diverted one another with their imaginations of
the banquettings and entertainments he would give.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
They quoted the proverb about setting a peasant on
horseback, and made humorous allusions to Sancho
in Barataria.</p>

<p>The table-expenses, however, of this gluttonous
man and winebibber, during his abode in the
imperial palace, were just one florin a day. And if
his elevation to a post of authority was as unexpected
as Sancho's, his decisions in matters of
justice and good order were as remarkable for plain
sense. These, he made known to his loving
countrymen by sundry homely proclamations, which
were most exquisitely relished by the colonels,
counts, and barons aforesaid, but taken in sober
earnest by the people for whom they were intended.
All these began with "Beloved country-folk," and
"In the name of God, the Emperor, and the fatherland."</p>

<p>One of them enforced a strict restitution of all
unlawfully obtained property: another prohibited
every species of plunder, and enjoined a better observance
of the Sabbath: and directed that taverns
and dancing-rooms should be closed on that holy
day. Another dissuaded from music, except in
moderation; another recommended women not to
wear their dresses too low, too scanty, or of too thin
materials, (in all which the fashionable classes
flagrantly offended in 'the year nine,') lest the valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
mountainers should be led astray by their attractions.
All which was delightful to the counts, colonels, and
barons.</p>

<p>But the first proclamation of all could afford no
food for ridicule. It called upon all the inhabitants
of the Tyrol to observe a day of general thanksgiving
to Almighty God for blessing their cause and
delivering their country. It need not be said that it
met with universal and devout acceptance.</p>

<p>Truly it seemed as if the day had been won.</p>

<p>Hofer never affected the least departure from the
form of government established in the country by
Austria. No step was taken by him but in the
name of the Emperor, which the people gladly
obeyed. He levied taxes to enable him to carry on
the war, issued a coinage of twenty-kreutzer pieces,
divided the mountaineers into companies, and, as
far as was in his power, carried the ancient system
of government into effect.</p>

<p>One day, about this time, Hofer was cogitating
over a proclamation to the South Tyrolese, who were
taking some little advantage of the absence of their
commander, when one of his lieutenants suddenly
entered, and said abruptly,</p>

<p>"Sandwirth, here's Eisenstecken!"</p>

<p>"I cannot see him," said Hofer, reddening; "he
deserted us in our need."</p>

<p>"But he says he <em>must</em> see you&mdash;he's very sorry;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
and he has a special message from the Emperor;
and&mdash;in fact, here he is!"</p>

<p>In came Eisenstecken, looking still redder than
Hofer; but he walked straight up to him, held out
his hand, and said,</p>

<p>"Don't bear malice, Sandwirth; I did wrong,
I own it. I was faint-hearted, and threw up a good
cause as lost&mdash;many's the regret it has cost me!
But, come, I have been punished enough!"</p>

<p>Hofer, after a few moments' pause, held out his
hand to him, saying,</p>

<p>"I believe you, my lad. Why, every success of
ours must have been gall and wormwood to you!
Speckbacher chose the better part."</p>

<p>"He did, indeed, Obercommandant."</p>

<p>"Pish, lad! call me Sandwirth."</p>

<p>"Well, Sandwirth, I am an accredited agent from
the Emperor, to express his sympathy with you,
which he shows by sending a golden chain and
medal to be publicly conferred on you, and which
you are to wear for his sake."</p>

<p>Hofer's face glowed with pleasure. To be thus
remembered by his Emperor, and approved by him
in the sight of all! It was not the medal that was
so much to him, but what it typified.</p>

<p>It was resolved to connect this expression of the
Emperor's approbation with the celebration of a
solemn fast, which was fixed for the 4th of October.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
On that day, the Abbot of Wilten performed high
mass in the imperial church of the Holy Cross;
the aisles resounded with strains of heart-rending
music, the air was faint with incense; all the pomp
and ceremonial of the Romish Church was invoked
to add impression to the service; and at its conclusion,
Hofer, kneeling before the tomb of Maximilian,
surrounded by those armed bronze giants in
dread array, received from the Abbot's hands the
testimonial of his sovereign's favour amid the acclamations
of his countrymen. Tears coursed his
cheeks, as he breathed a secret prayer that he might
never disgrace this badge of merit.</p>

<p>Eisenstecken, whose heart had often burned
within him of late, at sundry ridicules of Hofer
among those who had failed to support him, now
looked on him as a man who had won a difficult
game, and respected and esteemed him accordingly.
Of this he shortly gave a very noteworthy proof, by
requesting a private interview with the Sandwirth,
and asking his concurrence in a purpose he had
much at heart. Hofer shook his head upon it when
he learnt its nature, but he spoke with perfect kindness;
and the event was, that Giuseppe was presently
seen, extremely well dressed, riding out of
Innsbruck on a little ambling pony.</p>

<p>It was yet early, and the young man rode on to
breakfast at Schönberg. He and his little pony had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
then five leagues of constant ascent up the Brenner.
After this tough pull, which placed him about six
thousand feet above the majority of mankind, he
reached the margin of the Eisach, which he followed
till he came to a romantic little town, overhung by a
picturesque old castle.</p>

<p>Here the pony was knocked up; so the young man,
having refreshed himself by a good dinner, started
for the Passeyrthal alone and on foot, by-paths that
he now knew very well.</p>

<p>The call to the cows was resounding through the
valley, when he came in sight of <i>am Sand</i> in the
warm glow of the setting sun. He sprang upon
a little knoll, to contemplate it more attentively;
and, lo! just beneath him, on the grass, sat a young
girl knitting, while beside her fed seven sheep and
three goats.</p>

<p>"Theresa!" cried he, half doubtfully.</p>

<p>She looked up at him in surprise. The next
moment he was beside her.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it you?" and an innocent blush mantled
on her cheek. "You bring news of my dear
father?"</p>

<p>"He is well; he sends his dear love to you all."</p>

<p>"Come to the house&mdash;my mother will be so glad
to see you! She will have a thousand questions
to ask."</p>

<p>"First,&mdash;are <em>you</em> glad, Theresa, to see me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly; very glad, indeed! Come in, by all
means. I ought to have driven home the sheep and
goats already, but thought I would finish off my
knitting first."</p>

<p>And, collecting her little flock, she alertly led
the way to the house; while Eisenstecken could
hardly make up his mind whether to detain her or
not.</p>

<p>"See," said he, offering her a flower, "here's
a pretty little thing I gathered on the mountain."</p>

<p>"Ah, don't touch it!" cried Theresa, shrinking
from it in dismay. "It's the thunder-rose!"</p>

<p>"Thunder-rose!&mdash;what's that?"</p>

<p>"Whoever gathers it will be unlucky&mdash;whoever
accepts it will be unlucky. Please, throw it away."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will," said Eisenstecken, looking
discomfited, and flinging it as far from him as he
could. "I hope it will not be verified in my case."</p>

<p>"I hope not. Let us think of something else."</p>

<p>He gladly changed the subject, and talked of what
was doing in Innsbruck; feeling the moment an
unpropitious one for saying what was hovering on
his lips.</p>

<p>Anna Hofer welcomed him kindly. There was
another person present&mdash;a young, wounded soldier,
sitting at the door, whom Giuseppe would fain have
not seen there. It was Rudolf.</p>

<p>Nothing that the house afforded was too good for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
the adjutant who brought glad tidings of the Sandwirth.
Trout, roast chicken, pastry, were heaped
upon his plate,&mdash;the best bed prepared for him, the
best pillow-case and coverlet placed upon it,&mdash;all
very hospitable and satisfactory; only&mdash;only there
was that handsome young soldier, with his arm
in a sling, receiving quieter but quite as flattering
attentions as himself, and exchanging many a soft
tone and softer glance with the smiling Theresa; all
of which combined to make poor Giuseppe fume
with jealousy, and kept him awake half the night.
A few hours' dreamless sleep, however, restored him;
he sprang up, full of ardour and self-confidence, and
followed Theresa to the fountain. There he told
her&mdash;what he had better not have told to any one&mdash;for
she was sorry, but steadfast, and confessed to him
her heart belonged to somebody else, and could not
be reclaimed.</p>

<p>The young man felt it very bitterly; he would
not break bread in the house again, nor cross the
threshold. He trudged back over the mountain,
and when he saw a thunder-rose, he stamped upon
it, saying, "Ah, you wretch! it was owing to
you."</p>

<p>At the inn where he had put up, he ate a pretty
good breakfast, mounted his little ambling pony, and
prepared to re-cross the Brenner, in a very bad
humour. As luck would have it, he picked up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
comrade on the road, whose cheerful talk beguiled
the tedium of the ascent. They dined together,
supped together, slept at Schönberg, and the next
day Eisenstecken had recovered his spirits.</p>

REVERSES.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the streets of London, about this time, might
be seen two sunburnt Tyrolese, rather bewildered
at the strange sights and sounds around
them, accompanying an Englishman to Lord Sidmouth's
office.</p>

<p>Their names were Müller and Schonecher: their
errand was soon told, in earnest, homely phrase.
England was the home of the free. England was
rich and sympathetic; the Tyrolese were fighting for
liberty, but they were poor; they could not even
muster enough money to buy gunpowder for their
rifles. The present lull could not be expected to
last long, for the enemy were already marching on
South Tyrol. Would not generous England help
them?</p>

<p>Of course such a question as this roused the
British soul; and the deputies were received as we
are wont to receive the latest comers, with hospitality
and distinction. They were feasted, they were
praised, they were encouraged; but&mdash;nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was done for them. People sated their eyes with
gazing at them, their ears with hearing them, and
then&mdash;one man went to his farm, another to his
merchandise; saying Government should take it up;
and Government said it was dangerous, and thought
it had better be done by private subscription. And
so, nothing was done at the time; and when the
grant of thirty thousand pounds was afterwards
announced to them by Lord Sidmouth, it was too
late&mdash;the war was ended.</p>

<p>The war burst out afresh in October. General
Peyri, at the head of six thousand men, advanced
upon Trent, summoning the Tyrolese to lay down
arms. Twelve hundred Tyrolese and Austrians met
his advanced guard at Ampezzo, and were repulsed
with great loss. A sharp action took place at
Lavis, in which the French were victors, and many
Tyrolese fell; but they rallied under Eisenstecken,
who drove the enemy back to Trent, and re-occupied
Lavis for some time.</p>

<p>A dismal reverse awaited Speckbacher in the pass
of Strub, where he was completely defeated, with
the loss of three hundred brave men. His dear
little boy, now just eleven, was hanging over him as
he lay terribly wounded on the field, and trying to
suppress the large tears that blinded him, while he
made a kind of <i>turniquet</i> for his father with his
twisted handkerchief, when a French soldier came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
up, and laid his hand on the little fellow's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah, cruel!" cried Speckbacher, half starting
up on his elbow, and sinking back again as the
blood welled from his wounds. "Spare my child!"</p>

<p>"<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il faut étrangler les petits louveteaux</i>," replied
the captor hoarsely; and unaware of the value of
the wolf he was leaving behind him, while he dragged
away its young.</p>

<p>Speckbacher groaned, and closed his eyes.
"Maria!" faintly murmured he&mdash;that name, so
sacred to a Catholic, made him feel for his crucifix.
He pressed it to his lips, but could not utter even
"ora"&mdash;hollow sounds, like the humming of innumerable
bees, rang in his ears; he became
insensible.</p>

<p>When consciousness was restored, he found himself
in his own dear home, with Maria ministering
to him. Directly she saw him recognise her, she
began to shed tears; but, like a brave woman as she
was, dashed them away.</p>

<p>"Where's Anderl?" asked Speckbacher faintly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, dear&mdash;hanging about somewhere,
looking after you&mdash;he will soon find where you are,
rely upon it."</p>

<p>Speckbacher <em>could</em> not; he knew more of his fate
than she did, but said nothing. What a heavy day
it was to him! He mourned for himself, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mourned for the men he had lost, he mourned for
his country, and he mourned for his dear little boy,
marching to a French prison. He could talk to his
wife of all but the last, but she would not let him&mdash;he
was weak from loss of blood, and she insisted
on his silence, and on his hearing her talk to him.</p>

<p>She told him that the Tyrolese, as soon as they
saw him cut down, without being able to rescue
him, retreated in disorder to the heights of Melek,
from whence they afterwards fell back to Innsbruck,
fighting as they went; that Rudolf had found him
lying insensible, and borne him off the field, and
that Father Joachim had bound up his wounds, and
sent him home in a bändl (or low cart on two fore-wheels),
well cushioned with trusses of straw, and in
charge of two men.</p>

<p>When Speckbacher saw her performing her various
little domestic duties thoughtfully, yet cheerfully,
and then remembered Anderl, his heart sank within
him.</p>

<p>Maria could not account for the nervous fever
that consumed him. His wounds were well dressed,
and she thought he ought to be doing better than
he was.</p>

<p>The next morning, after a dreamy, light-headed
night, Speckbacher, in a half stupor, heard, or
seemed to hear, a voice, a little way from the cottage,
somewhere about the stables, say cheerily&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hallo! here I am!"</p>

<p>"So I see," grumbled, or seemed to grumble,
Zoppel, in return; "what account hast thou to give
of thyself?"</p>

<p>"I've been taken prisoner, and run away. Does
any one know anything of father?"</p>

<p>"Ay, surely; he's ill in bed, as bad as can be."</p>

<p>"Oh, how glad I am that he's at home! I left
him all in a bath of blood. Zoppel!" (in an
eager, under-voice,) "has mother fretted much
about me?"</p>

<p>"How should she? She never wist harm had
come nigh thee."</p>

<p>"Heaven be praised! Father, then, did not tell
her! then, I'll not, Zoppel. I'm so hungry."</p>

<p>"Go in-doors, boy, bless thee, and get something
to eat."</p>

<p>"I think I must." And Speckbacher, whose
hearing was quickened by fever, presently could distinguish
the boy's stealthy footsteps in the adjoining
room. Meanwhile, his wife, waking, and leaning
over him to peer into his face, and see how he fared,
perceived a bright smile on his lips, though his eyes
were shut.</p>

<p>"You're shamming," said she cheerfully; "what
art smiling so about, Speckbacher?"</p>

<p>"Thoughts of my own," said he, smiling still.</p>

<p>"Come! tell me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look into the kitchen, Maria; I think Anderl
has come back."</p>

<p>"Ah, the young rogue, trust him for that!"</p>

<p>She did not dress one bit the faster; and, when
she entered the kitchen, greeted her boy just as
usual. He sprang in to his father, gave him a bright,
intelligent look, kissed him, and then laid his head
beside him on the pillow.</p>

<p>"Mother knows nothing," whispered he. "How
capital of you, father! Are you getting better?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear boy: now you are come home, I shall
get well very fast."</p>

<p>He did get well very fast; and was soon up and
doing, fighting with the enemy at Waldrung, where
he nearly fell into their hands.</p>

<p>The overwhelming force of France and Bavaria
was dispersing the Tyrolese in every quarter. In
the midst of this struggle, in which the mountaineers
were so willingly pouring out their life-blood, Austria
concluded a treaty of peace with France, and the
Tyrol was made over to Bavaria!</p>

<p>Conceive the feelings with which a revolted
slave, escaped back to his native chieftain, would
find himself consigned by him to the slave-dealer
again! Conceive, moreover, that the native chief
had, in the first instance, hired the slave to return
to him, and had openly or secretly encouraged him
all along!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Eugène Beauharnois published a manifesto, promising
the Tyrolese pardon and peace if they would
immediately lay down their arms. In consequence
of this, many hundreds of peasants, stunned at their
fate, submitted at once, while those who still continued
in arms were bereft of spirit and hope.</p>

<p>Hofer, for a few days, was paralysed. He left
Innsbruck, now nearly deserted by his men, and
returned to the Passeyrthal, to consider what was to
be done in this strait.</p>

<p>As he approached <i>am Sand</i> by the little winding
road among meadows that nearly passes the church,
he heard a loved voice on the other side of the
hedge; and another, neither loved nor lovely, but of
unpleasant quality, alternating with it. They were
not close to him, but drawing nearer, and every word,
through the clear air, was distinguishable.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, father."</p>

<p>"You will find it so, daughter. And if Hofer has
any sense in his head, he will do as I say. It is
decreed by Providence that the French shall be
victorious; and if he opposes that decree, he will
find himself knocking his head against a stone wall.
He might even do this and welcome, if his own
head only were concerned; but when his refusing
to lay down arms, or to call on his countrymen to
do so, compromises their safety, it is nothing short
of selfish cruelty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can it be so?" thought Hofer, pressing his hand
to his brow, in painful reflection, as the voices now
retired from him. He sat down under the hedge to
try to settle his mind; but he could not. While
thus sadly engaged, his faithful dog flew up to him,
and leaping gladly upon him, prevented him from
further reflection; so he rose and walked towards
<i>am Sand</i>. Just outside the house stood Theresa,
and the companion he had heard talking with her, a
priest,&mdash;of a very different sort from Father Joachim.
This man, with whom Hofer had had some previous
acquaintance, had a narrow brow, a cunning eye,
and something subtle in his gait and voice. As for
Theresa, it could be seen by a very slight motion of
the back of her neck, that she was displeased with
him, and would not assent to what he said.</p>

<p>"Ah! here's father!" joyfully exclaimed she, as
she turned round and saw Hofer. Running to
embrace him, she hastily whispered into his ear,
"Here is a tiresome, cunning French priest, who
wants to unsettle us all."</p>

<p>Hofer's reverence for the church made him give
a respectful reception to Father Donay, who, while
supper was preparing, drew him into the gallery
running round the first floor of the house, and there
talked to him long and earnestly.</p>

<p>"Is the soup nearly ready, mother?" said Theresa
impatiently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nearly, child."</p>

<p>"Then I shall call them in, for it will be quite
ready by the time they are seated, and I don't like
that priest to talk to my father. He's a bad one!"</p>

<p>"Hush, child!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em>, mother, I can tell you.&mdash;Father! supper's
ready!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hofer came in, looking gloomy, and began unlacing
his boots, saying his feet had swollen.
Theresa drew off his boots, and tenderly chafed his
ankles. There was a subdued, glittering light in the
priest's stealthy eye.</p>

<p>"Thou hast lost thy relish, may be, Anderl, for
country bread and cheese," said Anna, smiling.</p>

<p>"When I do, I hope the first mouthful of it will
choke me," returned the Sandwirth, vehemently
cutting up the loaf in huge slices.</p>

<p>"Cincinnatus, returned to his plough," observed
Father Donay ironically.</p>

<p>"I don't know aught of Saint Senatus," remarked
Anna, after a moment's thought; "is he in
our calendar, father?"</p>

<p>"No, my good woman,&mdash;no, daughter, no&mdash;A
good Roman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's to say a good Catholic, I suppose," said
Anna: but the priest did not answer her&mdash;his mouth
was full of soup.</p>

<p>Hofer could not get on with his bread and cheese.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
He sank sorrowfully back in his chair, and covered
his eyes with his hand.</p>

<p>"Take courage, son," said Father Donay; "consider
what a noble sacrifice thou art about to
make&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What sacrifice?" cried Anna hastily.</p>

<p>"The sacrifice of his will, daughter; the hardest
sacrifice man or woman can make."</p>

<p>"Something more than that," groaned Hofer.</p>

<p>"What's that?" cried Anna sharply. "Your
will was always a good one&mdash;why should you give it
up?"</p>

<p>"For the good of all&mdash;Hist, dear; these are not
women's affairs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, better change the subject," said Father
Donay.&mdash;"Tell me the meaning of those targets on
the wall."</p>

<p>"Boys' playthings, of old, father," said Hofer
sadly. "Dangerous ones, too."</p>

<p>During Father Donay's short stay at <i>am Sand</i>, he
never ceased urging on his host the imperative duty,
as a Christian patriot, of sacrificing his own views,
interests, and safety to the safety of his countrymen;
and even to place himself in the hands of
General Drouet.</p>

<p>Regulus could not have been more willing than
Hofer was to devote himself for the common cause;
and, with his judgment obscured by Jesuitical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
casuistry, he drew up a proclamation to his countrymen,
advising them to lay down their arms, and
consider their cause as lost.</p>

<p>The proclamation was received with despair by
Speckbacher; with disgust by a Tyrolese named
Kolb. He, meeting the Sandwirth near Sterzing,
whither he had accompanied Father Donay, and
where the unfortunate proclamation had been penned,
hotly remonstrated with him, and declared his conviction
that the document which contained the
intelligence of the peace was a forgery. Hofer was
confounded, and hastened home to re-digest his
thoughts; while Kolb proceeded industriously to
spread the impression of the forgery among the
other chiefs.</p>

<p>Speckbacher and Rudolf were at <i>am Sand</i>, impatiently
awaiting him.</p>

<p>"My friend, what is this you have done?" said
Speckbacher. "You have given boldness to the
vile and base, and discouraged those who were ready
to die for their country. It matters little whether
we and our weapon-brothers live a few years longer,
but it matters a good deal whether their descendants,
generation after generation, shall be freemen or
slaves. You say, 'We cannot maintain war against
the invincible forces of Napoleon.' Who made them
so, pray? In the majority of instances we have not
found them invincible, as long as we had powder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
bullets. 'Entirely abandoned by Austria,'&mdash;why, so
we have been all the summer, but what success we
have had! 'A power of a superior order guides the
footsteps of Napoleon.' O Hofer, Hofer! that <em>you</em>
should write that! It smacks of Father Donay, certainly.
'It is the immutable decree of Divine Providence
which decides victories and the condition of
states.' Doubtless it is, in a large way of speaking;
but Divine Providence takes into account the actions
of men possessed of free will, which it foresees, but
does not prevent. And as we have free will, if those
wills are bent on freeing the land, under the blessing
of God, from its enemies, doubtless it <em>will</em> be
freed!"</p>

<p>"Speckbacher, you make my heart burn!"</p>

<p>"<em>Let</em> it burn, Anderl. Take up your pen and
write something better&mdash;something that will rejoice
us."</p>

<p>"I hoped to do this from the first, but feared to
bring the blood of my countrymen on my head&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your countrymen are ready to shed it,&mdash;not on
<em>your</em> head. Your cause is the cause of all."</p>

<p>"You are sure I am justified."</p>

<p>"Certain. Write!"</p>

<p>Hofer sat down, flushing deeply; and wrote
quickly. The next day the following proclamation
was dispersed among the Tyrolese. Many wept over
it; many rejoiced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I felt inclined to lay down my arms, prevailed
upon by men whom I considered friends to my
country, but who, as I now have reason to suppose,
are its enemies: I therefore call on you, brethren,
to rejoin me. Were we to surrender to the enemy,
we should soon see the youth of the Tyrol dragged
away from their homes, our churches and convents
destroyed, divine worship abolished, and ourselves
overwhelmed with lasting misery. Fight, therefore,
in defence of your native country; I shall fight with
you and for you, as a father for his children."</p>

<p>The Tyrolese rose to arms immediately, and the
enemy was defeated with great loss. Generals Rusca
and Baraguay d'Hilliers were despatched into the
Pustherthal on the third of November, and on the
following day were gallantly encountered by the
Tyrolese, who were, however, driven back. Rusca
eagerly pursued them to Mulbach Clause, where he
met with most determined resistance; and, in his
endeavour to penetrate into Hofer's own valley,&mdash;the
Passeyrthal,&mdash;he was repulsed with the loss of
two thousand men, in killed, wounded, and prisoners.</p>

<p>This warfare raged throughout the month of
November, with various success; but the conquest
of the country became inevitable, though the peasantry
might retain possession of particular passes
and fastnesses.</p>

<p>Early in December, the struggle was over. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
peasantry were scattered; Father Joachim had
escaped to the Grisons; Peter Mayer was shot;
Speckbacher, who was the last to lay down arms,
found himself deserted; Hofer had disappeared.</p>

DANGER.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has been snowing all night. The Passeyrthal is
mantled in a garment of white; at first not
thicker than the fleece of a young lamb, but now
ankle-deep; and there is more snow above, ready
to fall.</p>

<p>A young girl, with drooping head and careworn
mien, is issuing from <i>am Sand</i> with her milk-pail,
and making her way to the cow-house, while it
is yet scarcely day-dawn. Suddenly she stumbled
over a man, bending down to the ground, and so
intently engaged in measuring a foot-print on the
snow, as not to have been aware of her vicinity.
Instantly her voice is raised in shrill indignation.</p>

<p>"You pitiful priest! You mean, sneaking man!
You may measure that foot-print as long as you will,
for it was not made by father! You base, wicked
Frenchman!&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My pretty girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call me so again if you dare! Oh, you wretch!
it isn't the first time you've tried the power of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
sweet words with me! Caitiff priest! Some of
these days your frock will be pulled off; aye, and
your mask first! Oh, you wicked, wicked man!"</p>

<p>Donay was actually petrified by her objurgations.
He slunk away; but still, with an eye to his original
purpose, in the track of the footsteps he had been
measuring. Theresa, white with rage, was standing
like a statue, watching his retreating form, when she
found a strong arm thrown around her, and drawing
her into the cow-house. Rudolf was shaking with
suppressed laughter.</p>

<p>"Theresa! let the old hound follow the false scent,"
said he. "What do you think I did? I found this
fellow lurking about, overnight; so I got a pair of
the Sandwirth's old laced boots, put them over my
own, and trudged right away with them to the edge
of a steep bank, where the snow has drifted to
the depth of seven or eight feet! Then I crawled
along to the top of the hedge, without minding
scratches, shovelling the snow about, here and
there, so as to leave no track by which I could be
traced, and returned in my own boots. Into that
pitfall he'll go! Ha, ha, ha!&mdash;And serve him
right!"</p>

<p>"Quite right," said Theresa, between laughing
and crying; "but, you see, he has got the measure
of father's foot."</p>

<p>"But that won't hinder his being led astray. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
I shall deceive them all, rogues as they are, over and
over again, as you'll see, with this precious pair of
old boots. Two parties of spies have been buried
under avalanches already. And though they go
peering and prowling about every dwelling and outhouse
in the valley, asking their sly questions,
'Where's <i>Sandvird</i>? when was he last seen?' they
always get the same stupid, indifferent-like answer,
'I don't know.'"</p>

<p>Rudolf drawled this out in such ludicrous caricature,
that Theresa could not help laughing heartily.
"But it is too shocking to laugh about," said she,
checking herself with a deep sigh. "Poor father!"</p>

<p>"I am convinced he will escape them, Theresa.
He is not a sanguine man; but when we parted, he
said with such steadiness, 'I trust in God, in my
faithful brothers, and in a certain nook in Passeyr,'
that I believed him."</p>

<p>"How did mother bear up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, bravely. We travelled quite silently, for
more reasons than one. Our voices might have
been heard&mdash;they might have brought an avalanche
down upon us from the Oetzberg&mdash;and our hearts
were heavy. When we got to the châlet, however,&mdash;(it
lies very high up, quite among the glaciers!)
we found it situated in a kind of little kessel,<a name="FNanchor_D_5" id="FNanchor_D_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_5" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
so as to be very unlikely to be discovered. A thicket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
of pines shelters it; there is a little pool or pond
near the door; a stable below, a loft above, in
which Johann and I slept&mdash;or rather, he whimpered
himself to sleep, but I lay awake, thinking matters
over."</p>

<p>"No wonder!&mdash;Ah!&mdash;" (sighing.)</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it was no good to stay there till
it got too light, especially as it was snowing, which
would prevent my retracing our track if I delayed,
and effaced mine along with it if I were quick. The
Sandwirth was serious, but quite calm and hearty.
Your good mother offered me some breakfast, but I
would not diminish their little store."</p>

<p>"That reminds me, Rudolf! They will soon be
in want of food!"</p>

<p>"Soon, but not just yet. I think we may leave
them alone another week."</p>

<p>"Oh, only think if their stock should fall short!
Cold, peril, and famine <em>too</em>!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, at the end of this week, which will
be in four days, I will start off with a fresh supply
if I <em>can</em>."</p>

<p>"If you <em>can</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Theresa; remember everything does not
depend on me; the weather may be tempestuous,
the search more vigorous and less easily baffled; but
what man <em>can</em> do, I <em>will</em> do, rely upon it."</p>

<p>Theresa rewarded him with a grateful look, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
then began to milk the cow. He stood by her the
while.</p>

<p>"How everything has changed, Theresa!"</p>

<p>"Changed <em>indeed</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> am not changed."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"The winter, with its snows and its ice-blasts, is
not more different from the summer, with its ripe
fruits and sunshine, than the prospects of the Tyrolese
now are, from what they were a few months,
even weeks, ago!"</p>

<p>"No. Still I am glad we tried to free ourselves,
though it did not please God to give us success.
We can feel self-respect. Even our enemies must,
I think, reluctantly respect us."</p>

<p>"Not they! Mark you, Theresa: I believe that
when people lose self-respect, they also lose by
degrees even the perception of what is respectable.
Sometimes, o' nights, such big, swelling thoughts
fill my head,&mdash;I think, 'Surely, what we have done,
this Anno Domini Nine, will <em>live</em>? people will talk
of it hereafter, when we have long been dead and
buried?' And then I think, 'Ah, no! See how the
emperor,&mdash;"our Franzel," as we used fondly to call
him, who was most of all beholden to us, and who
put us up to what we did,&mdash;'see how he has fallen
off from us, like a snow-drift from the hill-side, that
the river in the ravine below sweeps away for ever!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
See how it's the fashion already&mdash;how it was the
fashion, even while we were winning glorious victories&mdash;for
the Austrian counts and barons to look
down on us, with a contemptuous pity, as a set of
honest-hearted loggerheads!'&mdash;I say, you sir!"
shouted Rudolf, interrupting himself, as he caught
the twinkle of an eye gazing in upon them through
a chink between the logs; and rushing out, he
collared the spy, and gave him a good shake.</p>

<p>"Why, how now?" cried the intruder, who proved
to be Franz. "What's this for?&mdash;what have I been
a doing?"</p>

<p>"Spying and prying," said Rudolf, bluntly.</p>

<p>"Spying and prying?" quoth he. "Why, what
have I come this long way all across the snow for, but
to ask after the Sandwirth, and to offer Theresa a root
of the gems-wurz, which, if he eats before sunrise,
will make him bullet-proof? There now!"</p>

<p>And Franz drew himself up like a man aggrieved.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Theresa, carrying her milk-pail
towards the dairy; "but how am I to get it to
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>you</em> know where he is!" said Franz, insinuatingly.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," said Theresa, who therein, as far
as her personal acquaintance with the locality was
concerned, spoke the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you like me to look for him, then?" said
Franz, slily.</p>

<p>"No, I should not," answered Theresa, very
quickly; adding, "I don't want you to meddle at all
in our affairs."</p>

<p>"Well, certainly, one has not much encouragement
to do so, except for good-will," said Franz,
following her into the house, and putting his cold
hands on the stove to warm them; "they're likely
to do what I am doing now&mdash;burn their fingers."</p>

<p>Rudolf's mother, who had come to be a companion
to Theresa in her parents' absence, now
poured out the porridge, and summoned the family
to breakfast. Theresa said to Franz, "You'll join
us, I suppose?" to which reluctant half-invitation,
he replied by drawing a stool to the table, and taking
his share with the rest.</p>

<p>He pricked up his ears to catch any allusion to
the Sandwirth, but none was made. A cloud had
settled heavily on them all; but they had already
learnt the needful lesson of silence.</p>

<p>Franz, after lounging about in his usual way, left
<i>am Sand</i>, announcing his intention of going to
Meran. Before he had proceeded far, however,
some one said "Hist!" and he looked round and
saw Donay.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the priest, coming up to him, and
walking with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Franz, "I've been there, and breakfasted
there, but to no good. Theresa wouldn't drop
a word that one could lay hold of."</p>

<p>"Ah, there are other things besides words that
sharp people can lay hold of," said Father Donay.
"For example, I have laid hold of something that
certifies to me the Sandwirth has been to his house
and from it, within these twelve hours."</p>

<p>"Aye? And yet, father, we've watched that house
as a cat watches a mouse!"</p>

<p>"Pooh, pooh!"</p>

<p>"What's your proof?"</p>

<p>"His footprints, my son. One day, at Innsbruck,
when your famous Hofer was lodging in the imperial
palace, he kept me waiting some time. I left without
seeing him; but, before I did so, happening to
observe a pair of his clumsy boots lying on the
parqueté floor, which they graced as well as <em>he</em> graced
the palace, I soiled my hands so far as to take their
length and breadth."</p>

<p>"That was far-sighted of you, father!" said Franz,
with a kind of sympathetic admiration.</p>

<p>"Well, I did not know at the time all that might
come of it&mdash;I merely amused myself by showing the
clumsy proportions to one or two in the camp; but
there must have been something pre-ordained&mdash;I
was but an instrument," said this pious priest.
"On coming to <i>am Sand</i> this morning, to look about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
a little, what should I see but numerous footprints
in the new-fallen snow, different from those of any
who are supposed to be sleeping in the house,
namely, women and children. I dropped on my
knees, and&mdash;<em>measured them</em>! they were Hofer's! I
afterwards tracked them across the pastures, full
half a mile, till&mdash;plump!&mdash;into the snow I sank till
it was above my head!"</p>

<p>Franz burst out laughing, and suddenly stopped
short, as he saw Father Donay turn red with wrath.</p>

<p>"You are rude to laugh," said the priest, with displeasure.
"I nearly lost my life, I can tell you!
When I floundered out, I found so many foot-tracks
that I got confused, and could make none of them
out to be Hofer's; yet, whoever it was who had
walked up to that spot, must have turned back or
gone on, unless, indeed, they could have been
smothered in the snow."</p>

<p>"Which he may have been, in the darkness of
night," cried Franz.</p>

<p>"Well, I think not; he might have floundered
about as I did," said Father Donay. "Life is equally
dear to us all, I suppose.&mdash;So, now I leave it to you
to find where he is, whether there or anywhere else;
and, when you do, you know your reward."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I like this job," cried Franz,
after a pause. "Do you know, father, in a miracle-play,
I once played Judas&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you've only got to play Judas again," said
the priest, with a sinister smile.</p>

<p>"What, and <em>hang</em> myself?" cried Franz, hoarsely.
"Why, father, what is it you are asking me?"</p>

<p>"You fool!" cried Father Donay, in a rage, "the
cases are not parallel: your allusion is blasphemous.
Let me hear no more of it, I pray."</p>

<p>Franz walked on, silent and astounded, doubting
which of them were the wickeder man. "The
Sandwirth," resumed he, at length, with a choke
in his voice, "has never done me a wrong&mdash;on
the contrary, nothing but good. It is only
Theresa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, if you can put up with that girl's scorn, you
can put up with anything," said Father Donay contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em> put up with it, and won't!" cried Franz;
"but it's making her pay pretty dearly, too, if her
father gets shot."</p>

<p>"Don't be such a dolt as to suppose it," said
Father Donay pacifyingly; "the worst he and she
will get is a good fright. He will be tried by court-martial;
probably acquitted, or reprimanded, or
sentenced to a short imprisonment, from which, at
Austria's intercession, he will be released."</p>

<p>"If I were sure of that&mdash;" said Franz, hesitating.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know I speak with authority?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
You know my credentials pretty well," said Father
Donay. "I have all but told you who empowers
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you have promised me absolution, if any
unforeseen evil comes of it&mdash;" said Franz, still
uneasily.</p>

<p>"How should I do otherwise, my son? I will
promise it twenty times, if that will make it any
stronger."</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;of course it will not. Well, then, I'll
think about it, father: and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And, if somebody else should do it while you
are only thinking about it, he'll get the reward
instead of you."</p>

<p>"That won't suit me at all!" cried Franz. "Why,
if I make up my mind to do an ill turn, I may as
well do it as not; the sin&mdash;that is, the&mdash;whatever it
is, will be the same&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The intention, but not the reward," said Father
Donay. "Heaven notes our intentions; man only
notes works."</p>

<p>"I wish I were fairly out of <em>this</em> work," exclaimed
Franz. "If Theresa, now, were to come
across me at this moment, she might overcome me
with a straw!"</p>

<p>"Truly, I believe you!" said Father Donay, with
ineffable scorn; "and men of straw, or men knocked
down by straws, are not the men <em>we pay</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" cried Franz, grinding his teeth, "if you
were not a priest, I should think some evil spirit
was within you."</p>

<p>"And I, without any if," coolly replied Donay,
"think an evil spirit <em>is</em> within you&mdash;the spirit of
irresolution. Come! no more of this child's play.
Are you going to throw away a cup of good milk
because there's a cow-hair in it?"</p>

<p>"Not I," cried Franz recklessly. "Nothing
venture, nothing have. Give me a fortnight, and
I'll hunt him up. When I was keeping the herds
up the mountains this summer, I made myself
pretty well acquainted with all the nooks and corners
of 'em; and I guess the man we are after to be in a
certain châlet in a certain spot that I chanced upon
one day, when I was seeking for cream o' the
moon."</p>

<p>"Cream o' the moon, indeed!" repeated Father
Donay, ironically. "Well&mdash;if you find him, and
enable us to find him, that will be better than
moonshine."</p>

<p>"But, father! if I find him, and point out to you
the place where he is, you may find him yourselves.
I wash my hands of taking him."</p>

<p>"Wash your hands by all means. We'll take
him."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;that's to be all, then?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"All, and enough."</p>

<p>"Just so. Good bye then, father&mdash;here we are at
St. Martin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>Benedicite</em>, my son."</p>

<p>The place of Hofer's concealment, a picturesque
little cow-house&mdash;nothing better&mdash;was about twelve
miles from his home, among the glaciers of the
Oetzthal, near the Timbler Joch, and in a position
that, for many months of every year, the snow made
quite inaccessible. The winter of the Year Nine,
however, was comparatively mild; and the châlet
might be reached with considerable fatigue, difficulty,
and danger.</p>

<p>At the door of this cow-house, then, stood the
man who&mdash;we will not say had strutted his little
hour on life's stage, for Hofer had never endeavoured
to ape a grandeur that he had not; he was a plain,
simple, upright man from first to last. He had
attained a great, though brief power, and had not
abused it: he had fallen from it, but not into
despair.</p>

<p>In the profound loneliness and inaction of his
present life, after so stirring a campaign, there
might have been a chance of his mind preying on
itself, had it not been for the constant sense of
danger. His heart did not indeed prey on itself,
but feed on itself it did. He mused much on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
late career, and on the anxious question, had he
been wasteful of human life or not? At this
moment, he was reading, for the twentieth time, a
letter which had found its way to him even in this
secluded spot&mdash;it was from the emperor himself&mdash;the
beloved Franzel! strenuously urging him to
leave his desolate retreat and take refuge in Vienna,
and pledging his imperial word for his safety. Yes,
this plain, homely man had thus been sued by his
sovereign, and had refused. He would not forsake
his family or his country.</p>

<p>His faithful wife had accompanied him, as in love
and duty bound, feeling her home to be under
whatever roof sheltered the head of her husband.
She had her distaff and knitting; and as they sat
among the trusses of hay chattering of this and that,
many a simple wile did the good woman successfully
use to lure her Anderl's thoughts from
anxious themes. Now, it was to explain some
family genealogy, some intermarriage she professed
nearly to have forgotten&mdash;then, when he
had wondered how she could be so forgetful, she
would branch off into correlative domestic histories,
harmless jests, recollections of wedding-feasts, baptisms,
and burials; then, broach some knotty point,
or ask him to recall some old legend or fairy-tale, or
local superstition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>Hofer had brought Johann with him partly out of
fondness, and to amuse Anna, partly lest he should
be seized as hostage; and partly because he knew
the little fellow to be without reticence, and as likely
to betray him from heedlessness as an enemy might
be from mischief.</p>

WINTER ON THE MOUNTAINS.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">O</span>N the 22d of January, about two hours before
dark, Theresa and Rudolf's mother were busily
packing a basket with as much as it would hold.</p>

<p>"When they started, there were four of them,"
observed Theresa, "and they carried four times as
much as can be carried by one; therefore their provisions
would last four times as long as they will
now, so we must send them the oftener. Meanwhile,
they shall have as much as Rudolf can carry.
Here's room for a bit of soap: and here's a corner
into which I can squeeze a cake for Johann. The
brandy&mdash;the oil&mdash;the bacon&mdash;the loaves&mdash;the dried
chamois,&mdash;do you think you can carry anything
more, Rudolf?"</p>

<p>Rudolf lifted the burthen, and pronounced it
"no weight at all." "However," added he, "there's
some difference in a burthen on a level floor like
this, and dragging one down the side of a mountain
too steep to scale, except in <em>crampons</em>; so I think it
will do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Just this one cheese more, Rudolf."</p>

<p>"Very well. I think that will do."</p>

<p>"Is it not rather too early to start yet?"</p>

<p>"It would be safer, in some respects, to wait
longer; but, considering the distance, and other
things, I might fail of reaching the châlet if I put it
off later."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. Oh, Rudolf! believe me, I know
full well the great dangers you are encountering for
my poor parents&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't name it, Theresa. Even if you were no
ways related to them, think you I would not do it
for the sake of Hofer?"</p>

<p>"Surely, surely!" cried his mother. "My boy
speaks well; but yet, Theresa, I think it were better
to go twice, than go overburthened and meet some
evil by the way."</p>

<p>"Rudolf," said Theresa, "you will laugh at what
I have prepared for you; but see! here is a loose
white garment, with a hood, to cover you quite up,
which, if you put on when you reach the mountains,
will enable you to cross the snow undiscerned."</p>

<p>"Excellent!" said Rudolf, arraying himself in it,
to make sure how it looked. "I shall certainly find
it useful."</p>

<p>Theresa rolled it up into as small a compass as
possible.</p>

<p>"And here are a few lumps of sugar, Rudolf:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
put one in your mouth when you reach the
glaciers&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You make too much of me," said he, tenderly.</p>

<p>"And now," said his mother, "let us kneel down
and pray."</p>

<p>With an atmosphere of sanctity about him, and
a heart full of good purposes, the young man cheerily
started on his perilous mission. It was yet light;
but as long as he kept among villages and cottages,
there was nothing in a man's trudging along, openly
carrying a basket. Once or twice, when he fancied
a suspicious eye rested upon it, he cried gaily, "I
hope you expect as good a dinner to-morrow as
I do!" and began whistling.</p>

<p>At length, after a walk of about six miles, he
found himself rising above the haunts of men,
though not beyond their observation. He now enveloped
himself in the white garment, which covered
his burthen as well as himself, put a lump of
sugar in his mouth, and pursued his way over
the frozen snow; looking like a snow-wreath himself.
Suddenly he perceived footprints in various
directions.</p>

<p>"Some one has been here lately," thought he:
"this outer crust has not long been crushed. Yet
who, without a purpose, would be here but the wolf
or bear?"</p>

<p>Turning the angle of a rock, he ran against a man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
who uttered a shriek, and sprang backwards, throwing
out his hands, and exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>"Avaunt, spirit of the mountain!"</p>

<p>Rudolf, instantly perceiving that his extraordinary
costume had made him mistaken for something
supernatural, would have seized his advantage by
rushing past with a flourish of his arms, and a wild,
terrific cry; but unfortunately his white drapery
fell off.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Rudolf!" exclaimed Franz, relieved.</p>

<p>"Franz!" cried Rudolf, in alarm and displeasure.
"What are you about here?"</p>

<p>"What are <em>you</em> about, you mean?" retorted
Franz. "One question's as good as another. To
whom are you carrying that basket?"</p>

<p>"That's no matter of yours!"</p>

<p>"I <em>know</em>. You can have but one object, and
that's to go to the Sandwirth."</p>

<p>"Look ye, Franz," said Rudolf, boiling over with
rage, and setting down his burthen: "this won't do
to go any further. Who are you, to interfere with
my objects, whatsoever they may be? We'll have it
out on this spot. I've got on my wrestling-ring;"
exhibiting a very thick silver ring on the little finger
of his right hand; "and, if you choose to persist in
this matter, we'll try a fall together, and I'll pitch
you afterwards into the bottomless lake."</p>

<p>As Rudolf suited the action to the word, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
flourishing his fists and bounding towards him,
Franz stepped aside in affright. He knew that the
loss of an eye, an ear, or a nose, often resulted from
these national combats; and his fear of Rudolf's
prowess was such, that nothing short of death, to
his belief, would ensue to him if he accepted the
challenge. As for the bottomless lake,&mdash;which was
a sullen piece of water in a neighbouring basin,
reported to be fed by no springs and have no outlet
for its waters; to be uninfluenced by the winds, and,
when affronted by having anything cast into it, to
blow up little tempests and thunder-storms of its
own,&mdash;Franz had a profound horror of it, and was
at this moment very unwillingly detained in its
vicinity.</p>

<p>Therefore, succumbing before Rudolf at once, he
querulously cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Saints alive, man! what are you dreaming of?
Who wants to be pitched into the bottomless lake?
Not I, for one, I can tell you, this cold weather;
and as for wrestling, I hope there are better ways of
warming one's self than that. I don't care where
you're going, not I,&mdash;rather you than me, on a
January night! You take your course, and leave
me alone to take mine; the mountain's free to us
both, I suppose." Saying which, he walked off very
fast.</p>

<p>Rudolf was terribly vexed. He was pretty sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
that Franz was hunting for the Sandwirth, and on
the right track, and would probably return and ferret
it out. After a few minutes' painful thought, he
resolved not to be instrumental to it, if he could
help it; and therefore went considerably out of his
way, in order that his footprints might lead Franz
astray, if he endeavoured to follow the trail.</p>

<p>The worst of it was, that Rudolf thus lost not only
time, but his way also. A good deal of snow had
fallen since his former expedition, and altered the
aspect of the ground, making that appear solid which
was unsubstantial, and creating mounds and hillocks
out of snowdrifts. Besides, it was growing dusk,
and the worst part of his journey lay before him. He
thought he recognised a rock, which he might reach
by cutting across what looked like an inclined plane.
All at once, he felt the snow give way beneath him&mdash;he
sank with great swiftness into an abyss of great
depth, and profoundly dark. He was not hurt&mdash;merely
shaken by his fall; but his perturbation was
extreme, and his first thought, be it said to his
praise, was not of himself, but of Hofer. He would
be starved to death! Who would ever know, till too
late, that Rudolf had never reached him?</p>

<p>The extremity roused him. He began to grope
about with his hands, but could feel nothing but
rough stones, and, here and there, what felt and
smelt like bones. Moving a little onward, he perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
a small speck of white afar off, which, it struck
him, was daylight. His eyes, now getting accustomed
to the intense darkness, could discern even
the faint twilight which, through some fissure, thus
attracted him. He cautiously advanced, found his
prison resolve itself into some sort of deep cavern;
and, advancing to its mouth, saw it guarded by two
huge bears! They were looking forth from the cave,
without moving, which gave him time to decide on
his course before they saw or scented him. Hastily
enveloping himself anew in the white garment, and
securing his precious basket to him by his red sash,
he took a large stone in each hand, and, uttering
a fearful yell, rushed from his retreat, extending his
white drapery high above his head.</p>

<p>The bears, who certainly had never beheld such
an apparition before, moved off in seeming trepidation;
and soon, mending their pace into a clumsy
trot, retreated into a neighbouring ravine.<a name="FNanchor_E_6" id="FNanchor_E_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_6" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>Rudolf, right glad to have dispersed his foes, wandered
on amid enormous masses of variously tinted
glaciers,&mdash;some deep blue, others sea-green, others
dirty yellow,&mdash;resounding with the hollow roar of
unseen waters; and here and there he encountered
the dead bodies of stags, and other animals, not in a
state of decomposition, but preserved by the cold in
a shrivelled condition, like mummies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the path became a mere shelf, and,
turning abruptly, disclosed a wide reach of valley at
a tremendous depth beneath.</p>

<p>An Englishman's head might have spun, but
Rudolf began to scramble upwards by what might be
called some giant steps; and as these occasioned
him one or two ugly slips, he coolly took off his boots,
cut his feet with a flint, and let the blood flow from
them, that its stickiness might enable his feet to
adhere to the rock with more tenacity.</p>

<p>He was presently stopped by a broad and deep
ridge of snow, which he found, on sounding, was
likely to prove as infirm as that which had deposited
him in the bears' cavern. But the trickling of water
beneath the ice had made a crevice between the
rock and the snow-bank; and along this Rudolf
squeezed himself sideways, till he emerged at the
foot of a glacier, dirty yellow without, but blue as
lapis lazuli within. He painfully climbed another
ridge by a zigzag course, and on through a wild glen
of dripping, dreary rocks; while the fitful wintry
blasts, sounding like the flappings of mighty wings
among the crags, alone broke the awful silence.</p>

<p>Night was closing round him; he took many false
steps, and repeatedly sank in snow to his waist. He
was beginning to feel something like despair, when,
lo! in a little rocky cup just below him, there lay
the châlet of Hofer!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>He could not resist giving a glad hurra and a
cheerful whistle, pretty sure that only the right people
would hear him. The next minute, he was at the
door, giving the concerted signal; and it was instantly
opened by Hofer, with his wife peering
anxiously over his shoulder, and Johann pressing
closely to her side.</p>

<p>"Rudolf, my dear lad!" cried Hofer, embracing
him. Anna embraced him too; and Johann, seeing
the basket of provisions, began to cry with joy.</p>

<p>"Fie, Johann!" said his mother, cheerfully; "we
are going to have a merry feasting, after all! Only
think, Rudolf, this silly child thought we were going
to starve!"</p>

<p>"A likely thing we would let you!" cried Rudolf.
"Why, I'd eat my own fingers first. Come and see
what a heap of good things there are in this basket
Johann! Here are some sausages, to begin with; and
a seasoned pie; and cheese&mdash;oh, what a cheese!"</p>

<p>"That's famous!" said Johann, hungrily; while
his mother sought to appease him by immediately
giving him something to eat.</p>

<p>A miserable little oil-lamp twinkled in the corner
of the stable; there was a cattle-trough, plenty of
hay and straw,&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p>"And how goes it with you, Sandwirth?" said
Rudolf, seizing his hand, as soon as he had secured
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"As well as may be, boy. A little down, of
course, now and then, with so much leisure for
thinking of the troubles I helped to bring on our
poor country."</p>

<p>"Never think that, I pray you, Sandwirth! You
tried to bring us out of them&mdash;and <em>did</em>. It was
only that we were deserted by our natural liege-protectors."</p>

<p>"Well, lad, don't speak against the powers that
be. If God had meant us to prosper, we should have
done so. His ways are hidden; but they're always
good. And our Franzel has written me a noble
letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Emperor!&mdash;<em>has</em> he?" cried Rudolf.</p>

<p>"Aye, that he has," said Anna, leaving the basket
to fetch the lamp; "do show it to him, Anderl."</p>

<p>"Why, how on earth did it reach you?"</p>

<p>"Eisenstecken knew this place," said Hofer.
"He's at Vienna now, and he sent the letter here by a
trusty hand&mdash;one who knew the mountains." As he
spoke, he drew the letter from his bosom, and placed
it in Rudolf's hand.</p>

<p>"Amazing!" said Rudolf, eagerly running through
it, while Anna held the lamp to enable him to read.
"Why, what prevents your accepting it?"</p>

<p>"What should make me accept it?" returned
Hofer. "What should such an one as I do at
Vienna? No, no!&mdash;where the tree was planted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
there let it fall. My country has been much to me,
and I've no mind to desert my country."</p>

<p>"Your countrymen burn to secure your safety.
Dear Sandwirth, reconsider this!"</p>

<p>"My sole thought," said Hofer, calmly laying his
hand on the young man's shoulder, "is how to
make a good end."</p>

<p>Rudolf looked wistfully at him. He thought he
seemed worn and wasted by anxiety and abstinence,
and his heart ached for him.</p>

<p>"Come," said he, gaily, "let us have some
supper before we talk any more of these matters.
I'm hungry enough, I can tell you; and I have
plenty of news of one sort and another."</p>

<p>"First about the dear children," said Anna,
eagerly. "Theresa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theresa is an angel," said Rudolf, hastily. "My
mother says she never knew any one to come up to
her&mdash;so thoughtful, and yet so tender."</p>

<p>"Aye, that's just Theresa," said Hofer; "and
a good daughter, Rudolf, will make a good wife,
I fancy."</p>

<p>"Sandwirth! you won't go from your word?"</p>

<p>"A likely thing I should," said Hofer, heartily.</p>

<p>"Come, let's drink to her," said Rudolf, anxious
to get Hofer to take some of the sustenance he so
much needed.</p>

<p>A couple of horn cups were filled with brandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
tempered with water, and handed round. Cold as
the weather was, there was no fire; but they kept
themselves warmly stowed among the trusses of hay.
In a little while, they grew quite genial. Anna
plunged the only knife into the savoury pie, and dispensed
its contents. Rudolf told all the news and
gossip he could think of, which was listened to with
avidity by Anna, and rewarded by many a short
laugh from the Sandwirth. Johann lay along on the
straw, eating as if he never would be satiated, hearing
all, and saying nothing,&mdash;quite content with the
present moment, especially when, in honour of old
customs, Rudolf sang a ballad, and the Sandwirth
told a fairy-tale. The story was this:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A young man, who had a fine cherry-tree, laden
with fruit, in his garden, had the fruit stolen year
after year by the fairies. Not guessing who were
the thieves, and anxious to detect the culprits, he
one year strewed the ground all round about the
cherry-tree with fine ashes, that he might see the
pillagers' footprints. Now, the 'little folk,' though
a beautiful race, have ugly little webbed feet, of
which they are much ashamed; for which reason
they wear very long garments. Well, the next
morning, the young man got up, and went out to
examine the cherry-tree, which he could see at a
glance had been stripped during the night. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
examining the ashes, he found them covered with
the impressions of little webbed feet, as if a flock of
geese had crossed them. He guessed the fairies to
be the thieves; and they were so angry with him for
detecting them, that, though they robbed his garden
no more, his cherry-tree never bore fruit again."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hour after hour, they continued talking; till
Johann, unable to keep his eyes open any longer,
crawled up to his straw-bed in the loft, which Rudolf
was to share with him.</p>

<p>Rudolf, now that his friend was strengthened and
refreshed, referred to the Emperor's letter, and
earnestly pleaded with him that the offer of protection
should be accepted. He dwelt on the state
of Europe,&mdash;as far as anything was known of it in
the Tyrol,&mdash;on the little probability there was that
any good would result from continuing to hold out,
or from awaiting another rising.</p>

<p>"The spring will come, and find you just where
you are," continued he, "unless some degrees worse
off. You will have no resource but to accept the
Emperor's offer; for every old ruin of a castle in the
Tyrol will continue to be garrisoned with French and
Bavarian soldiers, who will have so little to do, that
their commanders will pursue the search after you,
by way of keeping them out of idleness. So, why
not give in at once, when you may slip out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
country more safety than when the mountain passes
can be again used by other than mountaineers?
Your country, your religion demand that you should
not throw away a life that may yet be eminently
useful; and common sense shows that the most
prudent care to take of it will be to quit the Tyrol."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, listen to him, Anderl!" said Anna,
earnestly; and the two argued and persuaded, till at
length Hofer gave way, and consented to write to
the Emperor, accepting the protection he had so
lately declined, and asking for an escort.</p>

<p>Rudolf undertook to speed this missive to Vienna;
and after some further talk, which carried them far
into the night, he repaired to the loft, where he soon
lay in dreamless sleep. The following morning, after
another domestic council, and innumerable kind
messages and promises exchanged, he, with hearty
farewells, sped on his homeward route before it was
yet light.</p>

THE CHÂLET.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">A</span> FEW hours after Rudolf had gone, Hofer was
standing at the door of his hut, when he
thought he saw a dark object stealthily moving
among the firs. At first he took it for some animal
of prey, but his next impression was that it was a
human creature on all fours; and, as he had certainly
been himself seen, he thought he lost nothing
by rushing out on the intruder.</p>

<p>A man, creeping along under an ox-hide, started
up, and proved to be Franz.</p>

<p>"What do you here?" cried Hofer.</p>

<p>"Why, Sandwirth, can that be you?" said Franz,
in seeming astonishment. "Why, how you surprise
me! How are you?&mdash;How altered you are, to be
sure!"</p>

<p>"Very likely, Franz; but the question is, what
brought you here to seek me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing brought me&mdash;how should I guess where
you were?" returned Franz, hardily. "I came to
look for a strayed calf."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I've sought for a strayed calf too, in my
time, but never up this high in deep winter, nor yet
on all fours with an ox-hide over me. Franz!&mdash;now,
don't tamper with an old friend. I've oft had
dealings with you, and I've done you many a kindness.
You know, my lad, I'm in jeopardy, and you
know that if you say where I am, you will get me
into trouble&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What matter is it of mine?" grumbled Franz.
"What good would it do me?"</p>

<p>"As to the <em>real</em> good it would do you, I think you
would get none; but as to a handful of zwanzigers,
I dare say they would give you so much, for the
price of your old friend's blood."</p>

<p>"Don't talk in that way, Sandwirth," said Franz,
whiningly. "Poor as I am,&mdash;and I'm very poor,&mdash;I
hope I'm not so bad as you think me."</p>

<p>"Well, Franz, as to poor, you have made a good
deal of money in your time; and it has always been
your way to be with full pockets one day and empty
ones the next&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they're <em>always</em> empty now, Sandwirth, for I
can't do a stroke of business, and my mother's dead,
and my sister's married to Karl Hoven, and Karl
won't speak to me; so that I'm really what one may
call <em>in want</em>."</p>

<p>"Well, boy, well&mdash;the case is hard, I grant ye:
but bad as it is, you'll make it worse if you take to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
evil courses. Go to Nicolas Wagner at Botzen&mdash;tell
him that the last time you saw me, I bade you
go to him and say I hoped he would give you some
employment. And be mum&mdash;do you observe?&mdash;as
to when that was. Stay, here are a couple of dollars&mdash;it's
but little I have myself, and I shall perhaps
need them shortly, as much as yourself; but you
shall have them. Now, go; and forget where or
when you have seen me; and according as you are
faithful to your old comrade, may your worldly
affairs prosper."</p>

<p>Franz looked sheepish, made a movement of his
hand towards Hofer's, drew it back, and crept off.
Even his gait was that of a caitiff.</p>

<p>"How altered the Sandwirth is!" mused he&mdash;"his
hair, that was raven black, is now half grey; his
beard looks as if it hadn't been trimmed for a
month. His face is full of lines and furrows, and
he is very thin. Why, he isn't half the bulk he was!&mdash;very
likely, knows pretty well what it is to want
victuals. Well, so do I; and when a man wants
victuals, it makes him ready to do things that he
wouldn't think of doing when full fed. Why now,
these two dollars will keep me four days, I'll say&mdash;they
won't keep me longer, because, this cold
weather, I must drink as well as eat. At the end of
that time, I must starve, unless through Father
Donay; for, as to Nicolas Wagner of Botzen,&mdash;no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
I thank ye! I'm as good a fellow as he; I won't
work under him! Still, I can't be too hard upon
the Sandwirth&mdash;I'll give him a fair start. He
dropped that perhaps he should soon be as much in
want of dollars as myself. Now, as he can't spend
them on the mountain-top, that must intimate that
he means soon to leave it&mdash;very likely, now that he
has taken alarm at me, he'll steal off this very night.
All the better for us both, if he does. Because all I
engaged for, to Father Donay, was to find out where
he was. I've done that, and I can lead to the spot;
but if, when they reach it, the steed is gone and the
stable empty,&mdash;why, that won't be <em>my</em> fault, I say.
Besides, they may soon make out his track and
follow it; but meanwhile, my part in the business
will be done. Well, but I won't do it while the
Sandwirth's money is keeping me in bread. No, no;
I'll give him his chance while it lasts, and I'll make
it last four days&mdash;that will be hon ... hum!&mdash;I
won't go a-near Father Donay the while, or I
shouldn't make it last so long, and he'd get the
secret out of me too soon&mdash;No, no."</p>

<p>At this instant, Franz&mdash;who, while his mind was
thus pre-occupied, had unwittingly followed the
path by which Rudolf had gone to the châlet instead
of that by which he had returned from it&mdash;suddenly
came upon the two bears, who instantly pursued
him; and in his hurry and affright, he was precipitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
down a steep acclivity, down which he
pitched over and over, till he found himself several
hundred feet below his shaggy enemies, bruised and
breathless, but not seriously hurt.</p>

<p>The search which was being made for Speckbacher,
all this time, was quite as vigorous as for
Hofer. Minute descriptions of his person and
dress were published, large rewards offered for his
apprehension; and every nook and corner eagerly
searched for him by cruel and greedy enemies.</p>

<p>Speckbacher, on separating from his comrades,
had first concealed himself in the little mountain
hamlet of Dux; but his retreat being discovered, he
was obliged to retire from the haunts of man, and
was hunted from place to place, till at length he
found refuge in heights hitherto deemed inaccessible
save to the eagle and vulture. Here he underwent
incredible sufferings from cold, hunger, and fatigue;
but his indomitable nature made him prefer it to
submission to the enemy.</p>

<p>When Hofer returned to his châlet after the encounter
with Franz, his wife observed, "I really do
think, Anderl, it is now time you should cut off
your beard. It makes you unlike everybody else; and,
therefore, easily recognisable at a distance; whereas,
should a spy to whom you were personally unknown,
find his way up here, you, without your beard, might
easily persuade him you were somebody else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, that would be the hardest thing in the
world to me," said Hofer. "He might deceive
himself about me; but I could not deceive him.
Whenever a man has put to me the question, 'Are
you Hofer?' I have never yet said 'No;' and I
cannot begin now."</p>

<p>Anna was going to remonstrate; but he smiled
rather sadly at her and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It would be to little good, dear&mdash;we are already
discovered by Franz."</p>

<p>Here Johann burst into a loud fit of crying,
and flung himself on the straw; while Anna stood
speechless.</p>

<p>"We had better go somewhere else, then," said
she, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Where? We dare not descend into the valleys;
and if we stray about the mountains, Rudolf will
not know where to find us, and we shall perish with
hunger. Patience, dear wife! Rudolf may come
again in a few days, and we can then concert fresh
measures with him; or the emperor's safeguard
may arrive in the meantime, and we can then avail
ourselves of it."</p>

<p>"Ah, I hope we shall!"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. Cheer up, Johann! Perhaps
you will be staring at the pretty things in the shop-windows
of Vienna in another fortnight. Come
here, and see me carve this horn, and I'll tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a story about what I used to do when I was a little
boy."</p>

<p>While Hofer amused this wayward little son with
one story after another, rewarded therein by beguiling
himself of his own heavy thoughts, Anna
stood musing, with her eyes wistfully fixed on her
husband's rifle.</p>

<p>"It has brought down many a man in battle,"
thought she; "and why not now, if spies come lurking
about him to make a prey of him? He would
not do it, I know; but, I declare, if I espy any one
prowling about that has no business here, I'll see if
I can't manage to hit him myself!"</p>

<p>Just four evenings after his previous visit, Rudolf
reappeared. He did not think their provisions could
fall short yet; but he was anxious about Franz, and
he thought Hofer and his wife wanted cheering up,
and would be glad to know the message to the emperor
was already on its way; so he started with
a fresh-filled basket.</p>

<p>This time he met with no interruptions, and had
a prosperous journey; he had also the comfort of
finding his friends cheerful and hopeful. They talked
about his marriage with Theresa in the spring; the
household goods they would start with and those
which they must provide; and many a sage maxim
of thrifty housewifery did Anna repeat and Hofer
laugh at, and Rudolf promise to bear faithfully in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
mind. The evening, as usual, concluded with prayer.
Hofer was now in the habit of praying extempore
and with great fervour, after the usual offices of the
church; and Anna was wont to go over her beads
very devoutly, after which they all joined in singing
several simple hymns of a great many verses, and
then lay down for the night.</p>

<p>Rudolf, as usual, slept with Johann in the loft.
He was tired with his journey, and the evening had
altogether been more satisfactory than he expected;
yet, somehow, he could not settle to sleep. The
conversation respecting his marriage had been too
interesting and exciting to enable him to compose
himself; add to which, he had a vague fear of some
evil impending over the Sandwirth, for which he
seemed to have no need.</p>

<p>When he slept by snatches, it was to dream painfully:
of Theresa being borne from him by Franz
over crackling ice, beneath which they both disappeared&mdash;of
bears growling over her remains&mdash;of the
emperor's escort coming too late&mdash;of Hofer's hut
being attacked at dead of night&mdash;of the air ringing
with the sharp reports of rifles&mdash;of his throwing
himself between Hofer and Franz. Rudolf awoke
with a start; and smiled to hear Johann talking in
his sleep and saying, "Some more soup, mother."
Then he lay wakeful, but still, till day began to
break, when his quick ear became aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
measured tread of many men over the snow.
Springing to his feet, he shouted to Hofer below,&mdash;"The
enemy are on us!" and leapt from the loft-window
to the ground, followed by the dizzy Johann,
when both were immediately seized and bound. The
châlet was encircled by sixteen hundred French
soldiers, come to capture one unfortunate man.</p>

<p>The next instant, the châlet-door was opened from
within; and there stood the mild Hofer, in his red
waistcoat and green jacket, with the medal round his
neck; his dark eye calmly looking around. His was
the first voice that broke the thrilling silence.</p>

<p>"Speaks any one among you German?"</p>

<p>The commandant, Captain Renouard, here stepped
forward, accompanied by a gendarme, and said,
hurriedly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Are you Andreas Hofer?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>The clear voice rang through the air. Turning to
his wife, Johann, and Rudolf, he said,&mdash;"These
have offended in nothing; let them not be bound."</p>

<p>Then, addressing those whom he loved so deeply,
he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, and be steadfast. Suffer with patience:
so will your sins be forgiven."</p>

<p>Their bonds were not unloosed, and Hofer was
heavily chained hand and foot. Captain Renouard
entered the châlet for a moment, looked around,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
shrugged his shoulders, saw the noted rifle standing
in the corner, and brought it out.</p>

<p>"This is a clumsy piece, after all," said he, handing
it to the gendarme, after surveying it somewhat
curiously. "Take care! it's loaded!" dodging it in
some alarm, as the gendarme handled it carelessly.
It would have been singular if he had been shot by
Hofer's rifle, after all&mdash;the rifle that Hofer would
not fire in his own defence.</p>

<p>The word of command was given; the troops
closed around the prisoners, and began to descend
the mountain. Hofer trod as firmly as when the
master of Innsbruck. Anna's face was smeared
with tears; but she was too proud to sob, and chide
Johann for crying. Rudolf's heart beat wildly. He
looked on every side for Franz; but Franz, having
brought the party to the verge of the hollow, had
prudently decamped with Father Donay, to enjoy
such peace of mind as his conscience would
permit.</p>

<p>On approaching a village, the French band struck
up a lively strain of music, which nearly drove Anna
out of her senses; and with loud huzzas, they proclaimed
to the people who came rushing from their
cottages, that they had captured the famous "General
<i>Sanvird</i>; le fameux <i>Birbone</i>." They were answered
with tears, maledictions, and lamentations. Though
not permitted to approach the prisoners, the villagers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
kept up with them, crying aloud in voices that the
musicians could not drown&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never mind, Sandwirth! They'll bring vengeance
on their own heads, Sandwirth! Keep a
good heart! They won't dare to touch you! We'll
never, never forget you!"</p>

<p>And this in every town and village through which
they passed.</p>

<p>On reaching Meran, they were joined by the
weeping Theresa. She had been seized and bound at
<i>am Sand</i>, and the house plundered. The two little girls
had escaped and taken refuge with Rudolf's mother.</p>

<p>The only consolation of the unhappy family was
that they were together; but at Botzen they were
sundered. Here they were received with more
courtesy and kindness by General Baraguay d'Hilliers
than had yet been accorded them. He would not
triumph over a fallen foe, but received the brave and
unfortunate captive with a soldier's frankness. He
affected to be indignant at his chains, ordered them
instantly to be struck off, and appointed him and his
family a tolerably commodious prison, where they
were treated with as little rigour as was consistent
with their safety. Here they enjoyed the last snatch
of unrestrained family intercourse they were destined
to have on earth; it was embittered from many
sources, but yet it had its sweetness. Their friends
also had access to them; and many of the townspeople<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
of Botzen came to express their sympathy,&mdash;of
whom Hofer asked forgiveness for anything they
might have to impute to him; but he was only
answered by their tears. The French officers, also,
did all in their power to show, by their attentions,
their sense of the kindness exceeding mere humanity
which he had always shown his prisoners.</p>

<p>Some of them were surprised to behold the
serenity of his countenance, as he conversed with
his family, and gave them various directions concerning
affairs small as well as great. There seemed no
end to the people to whom he charged them to give
messages of kind remembrance; often with some
allusion to this one's wedding, or that one's illness,
which showed that his head was quite clear enough
to keep in view their minute affairs.</p>

<p>At length the hour of parting came, the last
embrace was given, the last kiss taken, though not
the last tear wept, by many; when he consigned his
wife and children, in the companionship of Rudolf,
to the appointed escort of French soldiers who were
to see them safely to <i>am Sand</i>, and restore all the
property that had been plundered.</p>

<p>"Sandwirth! I'll never forget you!&mdash;You'll soon
be among us again!" were the last words that burst
from Rudolf, as he clasped his friend in his arms,
and then hurried away with tears streaming down
his cheeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>After the heart-breaking separation, one or two
officers, with kindly feelings, would have interrupted
Hofer's solitude; but he mildly requested to be left
to himself. His guards said he prayed; whether he
wept, they did not say.</p>

<p>After a short interval of repose, he was sent,
under a strong escort, to Mantua, and confined in
a prison near the Porta Molina, already crowded by
many Tyrolese.</p>

<p>He was speedily tried by a court-martial, which
sat in the Palazzo d'Arco. Its president was General
Bisson, already embittered against him and his cause
by his own defeat. On comparing the votes, a great
difference of opinion was found as to the nature of
his sentence. The majority were for simple confinement:
one or two had the courage to vote for his
complete acquittal; but a telegraph from Milan
decided the question by decreeing <em>death in twenty-four
hours</em>,&mdash;thus putting the mediation of Austria
beyond his reach.</p>

TYRANNY RAMPANT, GRACE TRIUMPHANT.</h2>


<p class="uni"><span class="dropcap">H</span>OFER, though not expecting so sudden a
doom, received the announcement of it with
fortitude. "Let me see a priest," said he.</p>

<p>Father Manifesti, a dignified and venerable old
man, immediately came to him, and remained with
him to the hour of his death.</p>

<p>The greater part of the night was spent in devotional
exercises; the remainder in conversing on
the war; in the course of which, Hofer expressed
his firm conviction that the Tyrol must and would
eventually revert to Austria. He also penned the
following letter to an old friend and neighbour in the
Passeyrthal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"<span class="smcap">My very dear Brother</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"It is the will of God, that here, at Mantua,
I change a mortal for an eternal state. But, thanks
be to God! this step appears as easy to me as if it
were to conduct me elsewhere; and He will, doubtless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
support me, and conduct me safely to the end,
that my soul may join the company of the elect, in
that place where it may be permitted to me to implore
his mercy towards all those so dear to me
here below; those, especially, whose kindnesses have
reached me. You, yourself, my very dear friend,
and your wife, are included among the latter; and
my thanks are yours for the little book, and for
many things else. Pray for me!&mdash;you and all the
dear friends who yet live in the world I am leaving,&mdash;pray
for me! that I may be delivered from the
purgatory where I must otherwise, perhaps, suffer
for my sins.</p>

<p>"My very dear wife will take care that mass shall
be said, and a requiem sung, in the Chapel of St.
Martin, and that prayers shall be put up in the
parish churches. The innkeeper will provide meat
and soup, and half a pot of wine, for each of my
friends and relatives.</p>

<p>"My dear Puhler, go yourself to St. Martin, and
tell all to the innkeeper: he will do what is necessary;
but do not say a word to any other person of
the affair.</p>

<p>"May you, and all whom I leave behind me, be
well and happy in this world, till we meet in a better,
and praise God for ever. I beg all my friends, and
the inhabitants of Passeyr, to remember me in their
prayers. Let not my dear wife afflict herself too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
much on account of my death. I will pray for her,
and for all, in the presence of God.</p>

<p>"Farewell, fleeting world! death appears so sweet
as to render life unworthy of a tear.</p>

<p>"Written at five o'clock in the morning: and, at
nine, I go to God, and the glorious company of the
saints!</p>

<p>
"Thy beloved in this life,<br />
</p>
<p class="uni firma">"<span class="smcap">Andrew Hofer</span>,<br />
"Of Sand, in Passeyr.<br />
"Mantua, February 20, 1810.<br />
</p>

<p>"In the name and by the help of the Lord I shall
undertake this journey."</p></blockquote>

<p>At the appointed hour, he was led from his prison
cell to the bastion near the Porta Ceresa. On his
way thither, several Tyrolese threw themselves,
weeping, at his feet, and besought his blessing:
others pressed their anxious faces against their
prison-bars, as though to devour him with their
eyes, weeping and praying for him aloud. Hofer
paused, and begged forgiveness of them all, if, haply,
he had led them astray; assuring them he felt confident
they would yet be restored to the protection
of their loved emperor Franzel, for whom he gave
a final hurra.</p>

<p>He had already given into Father Manifesti's
charge all that he possessed, consisting of five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
florins in Austrian bank-notes, a silver snuff-box,
and two rosaries, entreating him to convey
them, with his last words, to his family.</p>

<p>Arrived at the bastion, the commanding-officer
ordered his men to halt. The grenadiers formed
a square, open in the rear; twelve men and a corporal
then stepped forward, while Hofer remained
standing in the centre.</p>

<p>The drummer then offered him a white handkerchief
to bind over his eyes, and desired him to kneel
down; but, to the first, Hofer replied, "I have been
accustomed to look into the mouths of cannon;"
and to the second, "No! I am accustomed to
stand in the presence of my Creator, and in that
posture will I deliver up my soul to Him." There
was a simple grandeur in his words and mien that
unsteadied the hands of his executioners. He gave
a twenty-kreutzer piece to the corporal, recommending
him to do his duty well, and pronounced
the word "Fire!" in a firm voice. But they all
fired ineffectually! A firmer hand, at length, proved
successful; and Hofer fell&mdash;fell, to rise to immortal
fame in this world, and eternal happiness in another!
Among the numerous crimes of Buonaparte, none
stains him with a greater disgrace than this.</p>

<p>Berthier, who was then at Vienna, excited general
indignation by the hypocrisy of his affected pity for
him, which led him even to assert that his death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
would give great pain to Napoleon, who would never
have permitted it, could he have helped it.</p>

<p>The spot on which he fell is still regarded as holy
ground. His body, instead of being left for some
time, as is usual, at the place of execution, was
immediately borne by the grenadiers on a black bier
to St. Michael's church, where it lay in state, watched
by a guard of honour, that the people might see that
the famous chieftain was actually slain.</p>

<p>The funeral then took place with all the impressive
solemnity of the Roman Catholic ritual, as though,
by the honour they paid his remains, the French
were anxious to compensate for the injuries they
had done him while living.</p>

<p>The voice of bitter weeping was heard from <i>am
Sand</i>. The valleys of the Tyrol were in sorrow.
Troops of dejected or indignant peasants were seen
hurrying across the mountains, to attend the funeral
services in the parish churches of the Passeyrthal.
The widow and orphans refused to be comforted.
A messenger from the Emperor Francis arrived at
<i>am Sand</i>, offering the family an asylum in Austria,
with money enough to settle themselves, and a pension
of two thousand florins. But, no; Anna Hofer
could not bring herself to leave <i>am Sand</i>. She accepted
the pension, and the promise to provide for
her son; but she herself would never quit the
old walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Speckbacher was not immediately aware of Hofer's
fall. We left him in his mountain fastnesses, dwelling
among perpetual snows, and only approaching
the haunts of men when impelled by hunger. On
one of these occasions, he was cautiously approaching
a group of people, consisting of a man, woman,
and some children, near the little village of Volderberg,
when it struck him that they appeared to be
fugitives like himself, and would probably prove
unable to assist him in his need.</p>

<p>On approaching them, O joy! he beheld his
Maria, with her children and honest Zoppel. They
had been driven from their home, and knew not
whither to turn, unless to some humble kinsfolk of
Zoppel's. Gratitude for their reunion made them,
for a time, insensible to their privations. Zoppel's
good cousin made them welcome to some out-buildings,
where Zoppel supported them for some
weeks by the labour of his hands. Even in this poor
refuge, they enjoyed sweet, though sorrowful, communion:
Maria had the children to occupy her, and
Speckbacher carved chamois-horns delicately, and
made those exquisite little bassi-relievi of birds, with
feathers fastened on paper, for which the Tyrolese
are so famous.</p>

<p>At length his hiding-place was suspected; they
withdrew to the ruin of an old castle, perched on
a dizzy peak. Here, too, his enemies tracked him;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
so he was obliged to tear himself again from his
beloved family, and seek refuge in a cavern on the
Gemshaken, one of the most inaccessible heights of
the Eisglet Scherr. Taking advantage of a fearful
snow-storm, which answered the purpose of effacing
his footsteps, he, aided by Zoppel, succeeded in conveying
to this dangerous place a stock of provisions,
sufficient to last a temperate mountaineer a fortnight
or three weeks. When these were exhausted, he
could only depend on the wild animals he caught by
stratagem, which he was obliged to eat raw, as the
smoke of a fire would have betrayed him to his
enemies. Endeavour to realize the terrible condition
of this man&mdash;his solitude, inaction, exposure to
intense cold, miserable food, and perpetual danger!
And yet, though fallen on evil times, he seems to
have bated no jot of heart or hope; but, in the true
spirit of a man and a Christian, to have endured.</p>

<p>At the close of winter, when the snow began to
melt, he had ventured a few paces from his cavern,
when an avalanche from the summit of the Gemshaken
suddenly descended with an awful noise, and
swept him along with it, down a descent of not less
than half a league.</p>

<p>Though to escape with life was marvellous, he
had not much reason to exult in his good fortune,
for he had dislocated his hip; and, finding himself
unable to return to his cavern, he painfully crawled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
towards the little village of Volderberg, which had
formerly given shelter to him with his family. He
did not reach the cottage of Zoppel's kinsman,
Hans, till after dark. Hans, hearing a slight sound
outside, thought a wolf was prowling round the
cottage, and approached the door cautiously with
his rifle. On beholding a man crouching down, he
at first took him for a spy, and was half ready to
give him the reception he had intended for the wolf;
but on hearing Speckbacher faintly say, "Hans,
don't you know me?" he became overwhelmed with
joy and grief.</p>

<p>"O master! is it you?" cried he. "O master!
master!"</p>

<p>"Draw me in, Hans,&mdash;draw me gently,&mdash;I have
broken some bone, I think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas! alas! and we knew not what had become
of you&mdash;my dame and I. We had given you over
as lost. And to think of the poor Sandwirth being
shot!"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hold!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Speckbacher began to cry like a child. His sobs
grew deeper and deeper, till they were terrible to hear.
The awe-stricken peasants stood beside him, pressing
their hands hard together, without venturing to
proffer a word. "Tell me how it all was," said he,
at length drying his eyes, and then bursting out
anew.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Hans told all he had heard; and Speckbacher
continued to weep. At length, the good woman of
the cottage got him to bed, tended him carefully,
and gave him a warm drink in which she had
infused a few drops of the steinbock's blood, that
rare and sovereign remedy for all hurts in the
mountains!</p>

<p>"This will throw you into a violent perspiration
and put you soundly to sleep," said she sapiently;
"and after twenty-four hours in bed, you will be
quite well. The water in which I have bathed your
wounds had had the ball that shot the steinbock
boiled in it, for that also is of sovereign virtue in
cases such as these."</p>

<p>Speckbacher did not lack faith; and, exhausted
by sorrow, pain, and fatigue, he soon justified his
hostess's prediction by sleeping profoundly, and for
many hours. When he woke, it was with a heavy
heart. Hans had called in a village doctor to see to
the dislocated hip-joint; the case required inaction,
but spies were abroad, and Hans did not believe his
safety from them could be reckoned on for a
moment. When night closed in, therefore, these
two faithful men took the tall Speckbacher in their
arms, and carried him through by-paths to his own
cottage at Rinn, two good leagues off, where they
deposited him in the stable.</p>

<p>Zoppel, sleeping in the loft, drowsily called out&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say! who's there?" Then, peering down
upon them, "Why, Hans! is it you?"</p>

<p>"Hist!" says Hans. "We've brought home
your master, and laid him on the straw; and now
we must be off, or day will break and we shall be
seen, which will spoil all."</p>

<p>"Oh, what joy!" murmurs Zoppel, somewhat incoherently,
as he slips on his clothes. He hastened
down to Speckbacher, and they had a long talk
together, before they could well see one another's
faces.</p>

<p>"But, master," says Zoppel, "I can't think how
on earth we shall manage, for Hans little guessed we
have some Bavarian soldiers quartered upon us, who
are lounging in and out all day, expecting you to be
hanging about your home. But I know what I'll
do! I'll dig a trench for you underneath where the
cattle stand, but beyond the reach of their hoofs,
and lay plenty of straw in it. Into this I will lift
you, and then cover you well up with straw, only
leaving you just room to breathe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Zoppel, I should like to see my wife
first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, master! no!&mdash;let her be, I advise ye.
Women are soft-hearted, and she would be distressed
beyond measure to see you in such a place,
and would always be fidgeting about, wanting to
make you more comfortable, and the soldiers would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
naturally ask themselves, 'Why does the woman go
so often into the stable?' and so you would be found
out. No, no&mdash;leave her to me, master; I'll find
the right time to tell her you're safe and not far off;
but if I told her <em>how</em> near you were, you wouldn't be
safe long!"</p>

<p>All this while, Zoppel was digging the trench with
might and main; and, as soon as it was finished, he
lifted his master into it, and covered him well up:
having previously given him a piece of bread and
a good draught of milk. It was well he had lost
no time in these proceedings; for scarcely had day
dawned, when a couple of Bavarian soldiers lounged
into the stable to look after their horses, and began
to talk to Zoppel while he appeared to be busy
cleaning some harness.</p>

<p>Speckbacher remained in this agreeable position
seven weeks! <i>un vivo sepolto</i>&mdash;unable to change his
position, and only taking such food as his servant
could administer to him thus recumbent. But it
was better than the cavern of Gemshaken&mdash;here he
had bread instead of raw meat, and milk instead
of snow-water: warmth instead of cold&mdash;society
instead of solitude&mdash;proximity to his family instead
of being beyond all ken of them&mdash;knowledge of the
affairs of the world without, instead of ignorance and
anxiety.</p>

<p>He could hear the hens cluck and the geese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
cackle; could look into the oxen's large, patient
eyes, without fear of their betraying him; could
now and then hear Maria's voice, Anderl's laugh,
and the baby's cry. One day Anderl and his little
sister had quite a long gossip just outside the stable,
within a yard of Speckbacher's ear. At other times,
he slily listened to the Bavarians; through whom,
as they cleaned their horses, he learned a good deal
of news that was not intended for him: among
other things, that they were heartily sick of their
present life.</p>

<p>His posture became almost intolerably irksome
and painful; but it effected one good thing; an
entire cure of his dislocated joint; and, when he
found himself growing impatient, he thought of Him
who was born in a manger.</p>

<p>At length, just as he was beginning to feel he
could bear it no longer, the soldiers ran in, began
saddling their horses, and, as he gathered from
them, were about to depart. In about an hour,
Zoppel came in, full of suppressed joy. After carefully
securing the door, "I am now going to dig
you up," said he, "wash you, dress you, and trim
your hair and beard; for if your wife were to see
you as you are, she would take you for a wild
beast."</p>

<p>Poor Speckbacher was quite a log in his hands;
for long inaction had deprived him of the use of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
limbs; and it was not in less than two or three days
that he was able to quit the stable. Meanwhile,
however, Zoppel, having finished his task much to
their mutual satisfaction, sought Maria, and told her
the wonderful secret. The joy of the meeting, when
she flew into the stable, need hardly be described.</p>

<p>It was felt, however, that the Tyrol could not
shelter him; therefore, as soon as he regained the
use of his limbs, he reluctantly gave the children
his farewell embrace and blessing, and started
at dusk towards the Styrian Alps, accompanied
the first league by his faithful wife.</p>

<p>Once across the Alps, he was no longer in danger;
and, after a fatiguing and painful journey, he
reached Vienna, where he was joined a few months
afterwards by his Maria and the children. Here they
remained quietly, till the Tyrol reverted to Austria,
when they returned to spend the remainder of their
days in their beloved country. Speckbacher lived till
1820, when he died at the age of fifty-two, and was
buried with military honours. His brave son Anderl
was recently, and may be now, superintendent of the
iron-works at Jenbach.</p>

<p>Father Joachim, after hiding in various quarters,
and leading a life of great peril for nearly a year, at
length succeeded in crossing the Bavarian Alps to
the Lake of Constance. By way of St. Gall, he
reached the abbey of Einsiedeln, in Switzerland.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
From thence he passed into the estates of Venice;
and, by way of Friuli and Carinthia, he at length
reached Vienna, where he found Speckbacher. He
received a golden cross and a sum of money from
the emperor, in acknowledgment of his loyal service;
and for some years afterwards, he officiated in
different cures in Lower Austria.</p>

<p>In 1848, the cry went through the Tyrol, "The
Rothbart is up again!" and eager volunteers flocked
round the old man, who was once more, as field-chaplain,
on his way to the battle-field in Italy.
Danger seemed to threaten the empire from that
quarter; and the Tyrolese, with their old fidelity,
were again ready to fight for Austria.</p>

<p>In 1856, the veteran had quarters assigned him in
the imperial summer-palace at Salzberg, with a
pension of a thousand florins per annum. There,
on fine days, he might be seen, scarcely more than
a year ago, sitting under the majestic trees in tranquil
meditation. His hair was silver-grey; he was
slightly lame, a little deaf, and very chary of his
speech: but, if spoken to of <em>the Year Nine</em>, his cheek
would kindle, his eye would light up, and the old
man would speak of his comrades and their stirring
deeds as if they were but of yesterday. His jubilee,&mdash;the
fiftieth anniversary of his priesthood,&mdash;was
held last September. Soon afterwards, the venerable
Capuchin was gathered to his fathers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>In the autumn of 1810, a wedding-train might
have been seen issuing from the little church of St.
Martin, and proceeding to <i>am Sand</i>. It was not
a gay, but a sympathetic festival, for many of
Hofer's companions in arms were there; and,
though several spies mingled among them, they were
on their guard, and would not be tempted by them
to pledge the dangerous toast, "Freiheit Zur Tyrol!"
But they drank health and happiness to Rudolf
and Theresa, and many an old allusion was safely
made, with a sigh, under the breath, and standing
apart; and they felt they all loved one another the
dearer for having suffered together in a generous
though lost cause.</p>

<p>In 1824, a tardy act of justice was done by the
Emperor of Austria. The remains of Hofer were
removed to Botzen; and thence, in solemn procession,
to Innsbruck, where they were interred in the
imperial church, on the day following the fourteenth
anniversary of his execution. The Tyrolese flocked
to join the funeral in astonishing multitudes. The
governor of the Tyrol took part in it; the nobles
and dignitaries of the land swelled the train; long
columns of imperial troops slowly marched to the
solemn strains of music that befit a soldier's funeral.
Then came the priests in their sacred vestments, with
crosier and crucifix borne aloft. On the coffin lay
Hofer's hat, sword, gold chain, and medal. Twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of his brother innkeepers bore the pall, and many of
his companions in arms followed in the procession.
The Abbot of Wiltau pronounced the funeral benediction,&mdash;a
requiem was chanted; and then&mdash;they
left his perishable remains with all the honours that
perishable men have to give.</p>

<p>A monument has since been erected over his
tomb, which is not far from that giant-guarded one
of the Emperor Maximilian, and excites as much
interest, though of a different kind. His statue
well represents him in his accustomed peasant-garb,
his face turned heavenward, one hand grasping the
national banner, the other holding the barrel of the
rifle slung from his shoulder. His sword-belt bears
his initials, and the date of the Year Nine. The
whole embodies your conception of the man.</p>

<p>His name continues to be a dangerous spell. It
is spoken under the breath, if spoken at all. Gold
cannot buy any memoir of his life in the Tyrol.
The German accounts of him are in the highest
degree depreciating. His poor relics in the Innsbruck
Museum were at one time deemed too exciting
to be seen. But his spirit still lives among
the mountains: his name will never perish.</p>

<p>It was soon after the statue had been erected,
that a couple of men might have been seen attentively
gazing upon it. The taller and elder of the
two leant strongly on the shoulder of the younger&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
likeness they bore one another bespoke them
father and son.</p>

<p>Speckbacher gazed long and earnestly&mdash;then
dashed away a tear. "'Tis himself," murmured he,
in a low, emphatic voice; "as like as stone can
be to flesh and blood. See, Anderl! how a plain,
homely, upright man may achieve fame! But yet
this sinks into nothing, compared with his heavenly
reward."</p>

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
